### ING Bank pays EUR 775 million for failing to prevent money laundering

ING Groep NV, the biggest financial services firm in the Netherlands and one of the biggest in Europe, has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ing-groep-settlement-money-laundering/dutch-bank-ing-fined-900-million-for-failing-to-spot-money-laundering-idUSKCN1LK0PE" target="_blank">agreed to pay EUR 775 million</a> to settle a Dutch government investigation into its failure to prevent criminals from using its banks to launder money. Dutch regulators said ING failed to prevent money laundering "structurally and for years", which meant, criminals had been using ING banks for well, a long time.

#### What's with the lingerie?

Dutch prosecutors found a number of suspicious transactions that did not the ring alarm bells. Among them were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ing-moneylaundering-europe-analysis/ing-penalty-puts-europes-money-laundering-controls-on-the-spot-idUSKCN1LK2BN" target="_blank">transactions by a "women's underwear trader"</a> who laundered EUR 150 million through the bank's accounts. Prosectors also found that ING accounts were used by a telecommunications company to pay bribes to officials in Uzbekistan (the company was penalized for bribery by the US and Dutch governments in 2016).

#### Repeated warnings

Dutch prosecutors said ING had been warned of weaknesses in its anti-money laundering procedures but the bank didn't do much to strengthen them. ING CEO Ralph Hamers admitted that the company "made unacceptable mistakes" and said it took measures against 10 employees.

#### Who else is facing the heat?

Danske Bank, a Danish bank, also admitted to weaknesses in its money laundering controls. The bank is investigating $150 million worth of transitions that went through a small branch in Estonia. Denmark's Business Minister Rasmus Jarlov now thinks <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-07/danske-bank-says-laundering-issues-bigger-than-first-thought" target="_blank">"something illegal"</a> occurred in Danske Bank.

#### Why does this matter?

Money laundering enables criminals move funds to support illicit activities. Therefore, banks that don't do sufficient due diligence of their customers enable criminal activity.
