### At Barclays, female bankers are paid a lot less then males

In its <a href="https://www.home.barclays/content/dam/barclayspublic/docs/InvestorRelations/AnnualReports/AR2017/Barclays%20PLC%20Annual%20Report%202017.pdf" target="_blank">FY2017 annual report</a> released today, British investment bank Barclays reported that female employees on average are paid just half the salaries of their male counterparts. On average, the bank has a gender pay gap of 48%, exacerbated by the greater proportion of men in higher paid roles, and more women in lower paid roles. In the UK, the mean pay gap for fixed salaries is at 26% while the gap is higher in Barclays International at 48%. The mean gap jumps to 60% for discretionary bonuses in the UK and 79% in Barclays International.

#### Why is this important?

Because it confirms many studies that women are structurally disadvantaged in the workplace, and the gender pay gap is one strong signal of such disadvantage. Studies have also shown that women are disadvantaged in recruitment for higher paid positions, and their salaries go down the moment they have a baby. Yep, the world is still an all boys' club.

#### And this matters because?

Women's rights are human rights. Women are entitled to the same opportunities as men, but in many industries, the odds are stacked against them. This is true in finance, as the Barclays report shows. And we won't be surprised if data from other banks (UK companies with more than 250 employees have until April 4 to disclose gender pay information as required by British law) are just as abysmal. But by acknowledging its large gender pay gap, Barclays may have set in motion what could be the start of meaningful gender-related reforms in the finance industry. We say, stay tuned.

### Omaha bank dumps the NRA

The First National Bank of Omaha today <a href="http://www.omaha.com/money/first-national-bank-of-omaha-ends-relationship-with-nra/article_c55d1003-5c88-59a1-83d5-3e7712863459.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that it has decided not to renew a contract with the National Rifle Association (NRA) to issue NRA-branded Visa cards. The bank said it reviewed its relationship with the NRA due to "customer feedback" and eventually decided not to renew the contract. The bank appears to have been spooked by calls for a boycott after it was cited in a <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/corporations-nra-f0d8074f2ca7/" target="_blank">list of companies</a> that does business with the NRA.

#### And in New York...

BlackRock, the world's largest investment manager in terms of assets, said it will start engaging with gun manufacturers "to understand their response" the Florida school shooting. The firm said it will hold dialogues with investee companies Sturm Ruger & Company (17% of shares) and American Outdoor Brands Corp. (11% of shares).

#### Why do these matter?

Finance is finally moving, and could actually have significant positive impact to reduce gun violence.  The impact will not be swift but as we like to say, money talks, and sometimes it talks louder than politics. We're cautiously optimistic on this one.

This is also known as "redlining" where minority groups in at least 61 metro areas are routinely denied bank loans. Funny, but once upon a time, a phenomenon called "reverse redlining" got us into the Great Recession.
