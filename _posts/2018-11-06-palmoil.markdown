### Palm oil execs accused of bribing Indonesian officials

Executives at a palm oil conglomerate in Indonesia have been <a href="https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN1N2097?__twitter_impression=true" target="_blank">arrested</a> by the country's anti-corruption agency for allegedly bribing provincial government officials over an environmental issue in a lake surrounded by palm oil plantations.

#### What went down in Indonesia

The Corruption Eradication Commission have arrested senior executives of Sinar Mas Agro and PT Binasawit Abadi Pratama, as well as officials and members of parliament of Central Kalimantan province over the alleged bribery. The execs <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2018/10/palm-oil-executives-arrested-in-bribery-scandal-in-indonesia/" target="_blank">apparently attempted to bribe</a> provincial officials to stop an inquiry on allegations that palm oil waste had been dumped into Lake Sembuluh in Borneo island. The lake is a major source of livelihood in the area for its fish supply but the fish supply has reportedly declined. Moreover, PT Binasawit was also apparently facing an investigation on its use of forest areas.

#### What's the conglomerate saying?

Golden Agri-Resources Ltd., the Singapore parent company of Sinar Mas Agro and PT Binasawit Abadi Pratama said it will cooperate with the investigation while Sinar Mas <a href="https://www.smart-tbk.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Statement_03_BAP_SMART_20181029.pdf" target="_blank">said</a> that if "a breach of the company's policies is determined, (it) will immediately take appropriate actions..."

#### Why does this matter?

Palm oil is an ingredient in practically everything we use from cosmetics and toiletries, to baked goods and cleaning agents. Golden Agri-Resources and its subsidiaries operate some of the world's largest palm oil plantations. The palm oil industry has been accused of contributing to deforestation and contaminating water resources. While the industry is governed by a certification body, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), environmental advocates <a href="http://www.saynotopalmoil.com/Whats_the_issue.php" target="_blank">continue to link some industry players</a> to negative environmental and social impacts. Indonesia and neighboring Malaysia account for 85% of total world production, so palm oil plantations there are also likely to have the most adverse impacts.
