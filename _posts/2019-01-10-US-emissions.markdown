### US carbon emissions rose for the first time in three years

The US' carbon emissions increased by 3.4% in 2018, a sharp increase from emissions recorded in 2017. According to preliminary figures released by the <a href="https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/" target="_blank">Rhodium Group</a>, last year's emissions increase reversed a three-year declining trend. It was also the highest annual rise since 2010.

#### Y tho?

Ironically, the rise in emissions can be linked to a strong US economy. Last year saw the US economy at its strongest since the Great Recession. This led to increased demand for power generation, more travel (gotta get those bucket lists checked off) and more transport of goods (ehr, Amazon Prime?). Last year's unusually cold winter also pushed demand for natural gas for heating. Emissions from the power sector, therefore, rose by 1.9% although transportation continued to be the top carbon emitter.

#### What's been the trend?

Carbon emissions in the US have been on a steady decline since its peak in 2007. Emissions fell by 12.1% (or an average of 1.6% per year) between 2007 and 2015. Emissions continued to decline in 2016 and 2017 although the pace of decline slowed. These two years were also marked with a strong economy. Meanwhile, emissions from power generation also dropped because of the decline in coal-based power generation and a shift to natural gas, wind and solar.

#### What now?

The spike in emissions endangers the US' ability to meet its commitment in Paris and threatens the global commitment as well. The US has a large environmental footprint and any increase in its emissions has a significant impact globally. President Trump plans to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement, but this is simply political rhetoric. Whether the US remains in the Paris Agreement or not, the damage has been done.
