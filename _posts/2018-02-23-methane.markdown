### Court says methane capture rule must be enforced

A federal judge has <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/23/second-judge-says-trump-can-t-keep-stalling-clean-air" target="_blank">ordered</a> the Trump administration to enforce a methane capture rule for oil and gas companies operating in public lands. US District Judge William Orrick of the Northern District of California ordered the implementation of a rule that will require oil and gas companies to capture methane that is flared at drilling sites. The court ruled that the delay in the implementation is "untethered to evidence" and likely to cause "irreparable injury" to states such as California and New Mexico from increased air pollution.

#### What's the story?

Earlier this month, the Interior Department said it is delaying the implementation of the Obama-era rule until January 2019 and that it plans to replace it with requirements that were in place before Obama. The oil and gas industry opposes the rule, and says it is unnecessary and "overly intrusive". The Trump administration says the rule is "overly burdensome" to the industry. Environmental advocates <a href="https://www.edf.org/methane-other-important-greenhouse-gas" target="_blank">say that methane emissions from oil and gas operations contributes significantly to climate change</a> because methane absorbs heat better than carbon dioxide and is therefore, more potent than carbon dioxide.

#### Why does this matter?

The Trump administration is not a fan of Obama-era environmental rules and has been either revoking or delaying their enforcement. But this is the second time that a judge has ordered the enforcement of methane capture, which means that this rule may just escape the White House's axe.
