### Generic drug makers expected to be charged for price-fixing

Citing unnamed but credible sources, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/generic-drug-companies-said-to-face-first-charges-in-u-s-probe" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> today that generic drug makers are facing charges of price-fixing as part of a four-year investigation into this alleged violation by the Department of Justice. Bloomberg reported that the government's anti-trust lawyers are preparing indictments against these drug companies, of which two may be indicted in the "coming months". Bloomberg sources also said another company could agree to plea guilty before the indictments come out. The drug companies are also facing lawsuits by 45 state attorneys over the same price-fixing allegations.

#### Remind me again

Generic drug makers have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/07/590217561/probe-into-generic-drug-price-fixing-set-to-widen" target="_blank">accused by the Justice Department and 45 states</a> of colluding to fix prices of generic drugs. The companies allegedly rigged the bidding processes by pharmacies. The alleged price-fixing scheme has resulted in an increase in health insurance premiums and copays, and bumped up Medicare and Medicaid. So if you've noticed an increase in your copays, this might be have been one of the causes.

#### Who are involved?

The investigation reportedly covers some of the big pharmaceutical companies such as Mylan NV (also known for its EpiPen drug), Teva Pharmacutical Industries, Endo International, and Sandoz (a unit of Novartis AG). Two executives of Heritage Pharmaceuticals earlier pleaded guilty. All companies have denied any involvement.

#### Why does this matter?

Because the cost of healthcare in the US has gone up to unsustainable levels and continues to do so, unfortunately. While healthcare cost is a complex issue and its steady increase can be linked to multiple factors, drug prices are part of the problem. Americans have some of the worst health indicators in the developed world and this just makes America sicker in more ways than one.

It seems like there are more men named John than women in top leadership positions in business and government. Yup, John is really popular.
