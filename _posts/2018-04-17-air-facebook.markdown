### We are breathing unsafe air

The <a href="https://www.stateofglobalair.org/sites/default/files/soga-2018-report.pdf" target="_blank">State of Global Air 2018 report</a> released today noted that 95% of the global population is breathing air that exceeds the World Health Organization's (WHO) safety guidelines. The most impacted populations are those in North Africa, West Africa and the Middle East, followed by countries in South Asia, specifically Bangladesh, Nepal, India and Pakistan. People in Australia, Brunei, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden and several Pacific island nations have the least polluted air. Overall pollution levels grew by 18% in 2017 from 2010.

#### Talk dirty to me

Pollution in North and West Africa and the Middle East is caused by windblown mineral dust, burning of solid fuels (such as coal or wood) at home for cooking or heating, and burning of agricultural lands or forests. South Asian pollution is due to coal-fired power plants as well as burning fuels at home and in agricultural lands. The report noted that China's air pollution levels have begun to go down, however, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India have experienced steep increases in air pollution exposure since 2010. For example, India experienced one of its worst periods of smog in the autumn of 2017, forcing closure of schools and flight cancellations. The pollution level at that time was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/asia/india-air-pollution.html" target="_blank">30 times</a> the level that is considered safe by the WHO.

#### What about ozone levels?

Ozone concentrations were higher in the US, West and Central sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, South Asia, and China. This is attributed to a number of factors such as increased emissions of ozone precursors and warmer temperatures. China, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Brazil are experiencing increased ozone concentrations.

#### Why does this matter?

Because pollution has become the sixth highest risk factor for early deaths worldwide. The report noted that exposure to high levels of pollution contributed to 4.1 million deaths from heart disease and stroke, lung cancer, chronic lung disease and respiratory infections in 2016. Yep, dirty air is killing us.

### Investors push for reforms in Facebook

Investors are <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/13/facebook-shareholders-seek-more-accountability-as-annual-meeting-set/" target="_blank">pushing for a number of reforms</a> in Facebook, ranging from shareholder rights to equal pay to limiting tax avoidance. Facebook filed its proxy statement, which included six shareholder proposals up for election:

<ul>
<li>Making one share equal one vote; </li>
<li>Creating a risk oversight committee; </li>
<li>Setting a simple majority vote instead of the current supermajority vote;</li>
<li>Creating a content governance report to oversee the company's content policies;</li>
<li>Creating a report to examine Facebook's goals in reducing the gender pay gap; and </li>
<li>Adopting 'responsible tax principles'. </li>
</ul>

Shareholders meet to vote on these proposals on May 31.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, accountability. The proposals follow two years of controversy in the world's social media company, the latest being its failure to protect users' data from Cambridge Analytica. In two days of Congressional hearings, CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted the company's mistakes, acknowledged ownership of content, promised to improve data protection, and hinted that he is open to regulation. Now investors want Facebook to prove that all these statements were not just lip service. And what's good for investors, should be good for users too.

#### **Quote of the day: Race Together in practical terms*

<em>...The question is, how can Starbucks have this program and not have it be viewed as "Training people on how to deal with black people?"</em> ~ M.J. McCallum, vice president and creative director of Muse Communications, referring to Starbucks' announcement that it will close all 8,000 stores on May 29 for a national racial-bias training. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/national/ct-starbucks-racial-bias-education-20180417-story.html" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
