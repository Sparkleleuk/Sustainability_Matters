### $3 billion and counting

Three weather and climate disasters in the first quarter of 2018 resulted in losses that exceeded $1 billion. The <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/" target="_blank">National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)</a>, which tracks weather and climate events in the US, said that these events also led to 34 deaths, with 22 killed in the January nor'easter that also led to heavy flooding in Boston and surrounding areas.

#### Why does this matter?

Without us realizing it, our snow days actually incur costs to the economy. In 2017, the cost of weather and climate-related disasters across the US skyrocketed to more than $309.4 billion, a new annual record. The NCEI recorded 16 events in 2017, each with losses that exceeded $1 billion. The cumulative cost of such events was higher than the $219.2 billion recorded in 2005 from the impacts of five massive hurricanes including Katrina.

#### Our take

Weather and climate events are costly to a nation for the lives lost and damage to human health, infrastructure and resources. Since 1980, the US has sustained 230 weather and climate disasters with cumulative loses exceeding $1.5 trillion. And these are just the upfront costs. The financial and non-financial costs of recovery and rehabilitation are not even reported. Scientists widely believe that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of weather patterns, which raises the risk of more disasters with devastating losses. There is no win-win situation here, there is only lose-lose.

#### **What we're reading**

A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SmhaI-WAcmEMqR8R9oL5Fxn0cZ0kfY8Z/view" target="_blank">new report</a> published by the United Nations Environmental Programme and private partners found that solar energy outgrew all other sources of energy in 2017. China led the increase in new solar capacity. Of the 157 gigawatts of renewable power capacity added worldwide last year, solar accounted for 98 of them.
