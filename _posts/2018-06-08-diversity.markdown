### Very slow growth of number of black employees in tech

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-08/tech-companies-still-aren-t-hiring-black-workers" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that the share of black employees in technology companies grew by a minuscule 0.6% from 2014 to 2017 despite increased corporate focus on diversity. Black employees in technical jobs in the eight largets tech companies rose to 3.1% in 2017 from 2.5% in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Black employees made up 7% of US tech workforce, and just 3% of the total workforce in Silicon Valley.

#### So what's the score?

Bloomberg compiled data from Apple, Cisco, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Twitter and found that Apple had the highest percentage of black technical workers with 7% in 2017, up from 6% the year before. Google and Facebook had the lowest with 1%, which remained unchanged from 2016.  

#### What happened to gender diversity?

It improved. For seven of the eight companies, the share of women in technical roles has gone up. Women now account for 23% of technical roles in Apple, up from 20% in 2016.. In Intel, women account for 22.7%, up from 19%. The share of women also grew in Google, Facebook and Twitter but remained at 15% in Cisco.

#### Why does diversity matter?

Because perspective. Studies have shown that companies with employees from diverse backgrounds benefit from different perspectives, making them better equipped to respond to new challenges. Silicon Valley is changing a bit, but the dominance of the white male remains unchallenged. Bruh.
