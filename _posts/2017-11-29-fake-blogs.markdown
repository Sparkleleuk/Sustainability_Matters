### Fake news meets the polar bear

Climate deniers have been using polar bears to spread misinformation on climate change, according to a new study published today. Blogs by climate deniers use the arctic ice and polar bears as proxies for undermining science-based research on the human causes of global warming. The [study](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/bix133/4644513), published by BioScience, noted that deniers also use scientific research on climate change but remove context or misinterpret information to influence how readers ultimately interpret the information.

#### How did they know?

The researchers compared 45 science-based blogs against 45 denier blogs and found that while science-based blogs affirm the impacts of global warming on arctic ice and polar bears, denier blogs focus on the uncertain impacts of global warming on these two factors. Deniers "question the accuracy of future predictionsâ€”implying that the rapid loss of Arctic ice recorded over the past 40 years induced by AGW (anthropogenic global warming) cannot serve as a guide to future conditions. This contrasts with the scientific consensus that polar bears will ultimately disappear if Arctic sea-ice declines continue unabated," the study stated.

#### Sounds familiar?

We must admit the strategy of questioning future predictions is more sophisticated than President Trump's tweets. A number of corporations and think-tanks, including Exxon Mobil, the Koch brothers (who recently bought into Time Inc.), and the Heartland Foundation, to name a few, have been known to have supported such anti-climate websites. With big money backing anti-climate misinformation, we think it's only going to become more sophisticated over time. Misinformation will become even more subtle, it will probably require a PhD to even distinguish a science-based report from a denier. Or maybe not. Maybe all it takes is the curiosity and patience to learn and understand the real issues. Maybe all it takes is reading up on sustainability every day. Did we just make a plug for Sustainability Matters?

**POLITICAL SPENDING**

### Some passives are getting more active

More and more mutual funds are supporting calls for increased transparency on corporate political spending. According to the [Center for Political Accountability](http://politicalaccountability.net/about/about-us), support for its shareholder resolutions asking companies to disclose political spending increased to 48% in 2017 from 43% in 2016, according to a [statement](http://files.politicalaccountability.net/reports/cpa-reports/mutual-fund-support-for-political-spending-disclosure-jumps-in-first-year-of-trump-presidency/Mutual_Fund_Report_2017_.pdf).

#### What's the deal with political spending?

Political spending became an issue after the Supreme Court decision on [Citizen's United](https://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/10/18/11527/citizens-united-decision-and-why-it-matters) in 2010. This ruling effectively lifted the ban on corporations and unions on political spending. While direct political contributions to a political campaign is still illegal, US corporations are now allowed to contribute to organizations that support political parties or candidates. This gave rise to Super PACs, which financed high profile ads during elections. Citizen's United gave corporations significantly higher leverage and influence over the political process. Because there is no such thing as a free lunch, corporations expect their spending to be repaid in the form of more favorable policies or legislation. In the last few years, investors have been interested in how much political spending companies are doing because of concerns that corporate money is increasingly shaping national policies.

#### Why is this important?

Pensions and savings are typically invested in [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp), which means our life savings are in one or more of these funds. More importantly, these funds represent us and it is therefore, important to know what they are up to. In the past, mutual funds were quiet observers, their voting activity predictable and usually aligning with the corporate position. But this report shows the investment giants are coming to life and taking a stronger stand.

#### Our take

Money talks. And investors can make help restore the integrity of democratic processes just by the size of their assets.
