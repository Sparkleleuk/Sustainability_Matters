### Record high carbon emissions in 2017

Global energy-related <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-energy-carbon-iea/global-carbon-emissions-hit-record-high-in-2017-idUSKBN1GY0RB" target="_blank">carbon emissions hit a record high</a> last year due to higher energy demand and a slow down in energy efficiency measures. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said carbon emissions hit a historic high of 32.5 gigatons up by 1.4% from the 2016 level.

#### How did this happen?

The IEA said global energy demand grew by 2.1% in 2017, the biggest jump in five years, while improvements in energy efficiency slowed down. The IEA added that energy efficiency was not the focus of policy makers, causing the decline in improvements. Asian countries accounted for two-thirds of the global increase in emissions where coal demand was also higher. China's emissions alone grow by 1.7%, although the growth would have been higher if it were not for its renewable energy capacity and its rapid switch from gas to coal. Other developed countries, like Japan, Britain and the US saw a decline, with the US experiencing the biggest drop by 0.5% because of higher renewables deployment.

#### Why does this matter?

The increase in global emissions makes it harder to reduce emissions after 2020. Climate change mitigation efforts, therefore, need to double up so that emissions can peak by 2020 and then start descending. This requires all hands on deck, but some powerful (although small) hands may refuse to play ball.

#### Is there a silver lining?

Renewable electricity generation also increased as wind, solar and hydropower capacities improved. Renewables-powered electricity consumption rose by 6.3%, the highest growth rate among all energy sources.

### Expect more mining action in Southern Utah

The US government this week <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-utah-energy/drillers-snap-up-federal-leases-near-utahs-wilderness-monuments-idUSKBN1GW1AL" target="_blank">auctioned off 51,000 acres of land</a> in southern Utah for energy development and nearly all leases up for grabs received winning bids. The Bureau of Land Management reported that all 43 parcels up for sale received winning bids averaging $28.68 per acre. The auction generated $1.56 million.

#### Why does this matter?

Because these parcels of land include areas close to national monuments that environmental advocates and Native American tribes are trying to protect. Some areas have significant cultural importance to the tribes and many fear that drilling could (and most likely will) cause irreparable environment damage. The Trump administration reduced the land area of the Bears Ears National Monument <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2018/03/02/BigEar.html" target="_blank">to open up the area to energy and mining firms</a>. Southern Utah is rich in uranium and other minerals.
