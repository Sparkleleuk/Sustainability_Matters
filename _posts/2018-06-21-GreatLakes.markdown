### Obama-era protection for oceans rescinded

The Trump administration has rolled back regulations protecting oceans, coastlines and lakes within the US territory, stating that these regulations were bureaucratic and imposed significant costs to businesses. Trump revoked a number of provisions in the National Ocean Policy signed by President Obama in 2010, following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest offshore oil spill in US history to date.

#### What's in the Obama policy?

The <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-stewardship-ocean-our-coasts-and-great-lakes" target="_blank">National Ocean Policy</a> ensures the country's "capacity to respond to climate change and ocean acidification" and mandated the federal government to protect, maintain and restore the health of oceans, coastal areas and the Great Lakes to support sustainable use of water resources for fisheries and other industries. The policy promoted on "stewardship" of water resources and noted that environmental protections are "intrinsically linked to environmental sustainability, human health and well-being, national prosperity, adaptation to climate and other environmental changes, social justice, international diplomacy, and national and homeland security.""

#### What's the Trump directive?

President Trump wants the "lawful use" of the ocean to promote economic prosperity and national security. "Ocean industries employ millions of Americans and support a strong national economy.  Domestic energy production from Federal waters strengthens the Nationâ€™s security and reduces reliance on imported energy," according to the Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-regarding-ocean-policy-advance-economic-security-environmental-interests-united-states/" target="_blank">executive order</a>.

#### What are people saying?

Environmentalists are not happy. Ocean Conservancy CEO Janis Searles Jones said the directive is "short-sighted" but the National Ocean Industries Association said the it will lead to "increased economic, enviornmental and energy security for America."

#### Why does this matter?

The new policy directive is consistent with the Trump's administration's approach to relax environmental regulations across the board, so no surprises there. Regulations covering national parks and protected areas have been watered down or removed altogether, effectively allowing extractive industries to operate in these locations. But this new directive is especially significant because it weakens a policy that was established tp prevent the recurrence of one of the most destructive oil spills in US history.

#### **Quote of the day: To be strong or to be weak**

<i>The dilemma is that if you're weak, if you're weak, which some people would like you to be, if you're really, really pathetically weak, the country's going to be overrun with millions of people. And if you're strong, then you don't have any heart. That's a tough dilemma. Perhaps I would rather be strong, but that's a tough dilemma.</i> ~President Trump on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/20/politics/trump-separation-action-immigration/index.html" target="_blank">signing an executive order</a> to keep immigrant families together at the border.
