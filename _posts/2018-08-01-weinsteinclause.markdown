### In comes the “Weinstein clause”

Mergers and acquisition (M&A) deals are integrating a so-called <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/-weinstein-clause-creeps-into-deals-as-wary-buyers-seek-cover" target="_blank">Weinstein clause</a> (think Harvey) in M&A contracts, in a sign that the corporate world considers #MeToo material to their business.  The clause requires sellers to carry out a due diligence on behaviours of executives, and allows buyers to get their money back if executives are found to be involved in sexual misconduct.

#### How does this work?

It varies depending on the deal but some deals have required sellers to legally attest that their executives have been good boys (or gals). Bloomberg reported that at least seven deals this year required such legal representation. In other deals, buyers may be able to claim some of the money paid the sale if misconduct is later on discovered. Some sellers have put money aside to cover such claims.

#### What’s driving the change?

Reputational and legal risks, primarily. Buyers don’t want to be saddled with a public relations nightmare and lawsuits when acquiring a new asset. M&As are meant to add value to a business after all, not bring in more problems. In some cases, investors are pushing for it, in addition to calls for gender diversity.

#### Why does this matter?

Because finally #MeToo is not just a social cause but also a financial one. The Weinstein clause, thus, puts executives on notice that inappropriate behavior will cost their companies a whole lot of money.

#### Our take

If you still think women are overreacting, think again. More than 400 executives have been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior in nearly two years. The misconduct is real.
