### New program directs employers to self-report labor violations

The Department of Labor (DOL) today announced a new <a href="http://thehill.com/regulation/labor/377032-labor-department-launches-pilot-program-to-allow-businesses-to-self-report" target="_blank">pilot program</a> that allows business owners to self-report potential overtime and wage violations. The DOL rolled out the Payroll Audit Independent Determination (PAID) system, a self-auditing program for businesses, to resolve worker claims over unpaid overtime and minimum wage obligations under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) without litigation.

#### What’s the DOL saying?

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta said the program provides employers a simple way to voluntarily come forward if they think they violated the FLSA and pay back wages. Companies that do will not have to pay civil monetary penalties as they would if the DOL investigates a labor complaint and finds the employer in violation. Employers currently under investigation and litigation will not be allowed to participate in the program.

#### And what about businesses?

Of course they like it. Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz said this is a “fairer and more sensible approach to regulation. The previous administration shot first and asked questions later. The Trump administration is primarily concerned with making sure businesses are compliant.” Businesses, of course, hate regulation. They hate litigation too, which is what happens when they violate the law.

#### Our take

We may be missing something here but doesn’t self-reporting and violation sound like an oxymoron to you? We’re thinking this program is a form of amnesty, not a way to ensure compliance. It’s the same way the IRS gives you a chance to pay your back taxes so you don’t go to jail. But unlike the IRS, which won't be as forgiving the next time you "forget" to pay taxes, the DOL seems to allow employers to commit the same violation again and again as long as it reports its violation. We’re taking this with a grain of salt. And raised eyebrows.

**BEFORE YOU GO...**

#### **Quote of the day: Will President Trump change his mind on climate?**

“My hope is that President Trump listens to his advisers and looks at the data and changes his mind. And if that’s the case, that shows a great leader who when facts change, and they recognize something different, they’re not bound to what they did before, they’re willing to change. And I think it’s fair to say this president does change his views — generally it’s one day to the next.” - Michael Bloomberg who was appointed the UN Special Envoy for Climate Action today. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/un-chief-appoints-bloomberg-as-envoy-for-climate-action/2018/03/05/94818f4c-20a9-11e8-946c-9420060cb7bd_story.html?utm_term=.3db2eb2149f4" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
