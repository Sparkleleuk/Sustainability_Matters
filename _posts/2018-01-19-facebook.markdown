### Facebook starts filtering out fake news

Facebook will start ranking news sources and publish media that are more trusted by users as part of its efforts to weed out fake news. CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck" target="_blank">wrote in a Facebook post</a>, that FB will "prioritize news that is trustworthy, informative, and local." To determine trustworthiness, the company will rank sources based on feedback from Facebook users.

#### Why does this matter?

Facebook, and other social media sites such as Twitter and YouTube, have been feeling the heat over its failure to police their content. In the last few years, social media sites have been the conduit of misinformation and fake news that are believed to have influenced elections in many countries such as the US and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk_ns1ynSRo&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">the Philippines</a>. Meanwhile, Twitter today said that <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/2016-election-update.html" target="_blank">677,775 people in the US</a> followed, retweeted or liked posts from accounts that are "potentially connected to a propaganda effort by a Russian government-linked organization known as the Internet Research Agency (IRA)." Twitter will be writing emails to the individuals who were exposed to the IRA-led misinformation.

Social media sites have also been accused of failing to police their sites of extremist material and hate speech, and <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/human%20rights/labor/csr/2017/12/19/hate-speech.html" target="_blank">face penalties in Europe</a> if they fail to significantly reduce extremist content.

#### Our take

Mark is right that there is "too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization". The catch though, is many sensational sites are also popular and many people actually believe they have the creds. How to distinguish the popular from the truly trustworthy is something for the algorithm to solve.
