### Saudi Arabia sets sights on solar power

Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil producer, is investing in renewables and hopes to generate 10% of its power needs from solar energy by 2023. It has contracted a local company, ACWA Power, to build a solar farm that would generate enough electricity to power up 200,000 homes, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/business/energy-environment/saudi-arabia-solar-renewables.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fclimate&action=click&contentCollection=climate&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">reported the New York Times</a>. The kingdom plans to invest up to $7 billion by the end of 2018 to develop at least seven new solar plants and a big wind farm.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, climate change. After years of empty promises on renewables, the world’s most oil-dependent country is finally putting down money to generate solar power and this helps global climate action. The less dependent the world is on fossil fuels, the lower the global carbon emissions. With approximately 22% of the world’s proven petroleum reserves, Saudi Arabia is not going to abandon the main source of its wealth any time soon. But at the very least, it seems to be acknowledging the need to diversify because it cannot rely on oil production forever. Not when oil prices have been low and the US is giving Saudi Arabia a run for its money with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-oil-record-shale-analysis/u-s-oil-industry-set-to-break-record-upend-global-trade-idUSKBN1F50HV" target="_blank">increased shale oil production</a>. Last year, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-energy-renewables/saudi-to-launch-30-50-billion-renewable-energy-program-soon-minister-idUSKBN1501HE" target="_blank">announced</a> that the country will launch a $30-50 billion investment in renewables by 2023. The country's economic reform program, or Vision 2030, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-renewable/saudi-arabia-pushes-ahead-with-renewable-drive-to-diversify-energy-mix-idUSL8N1HP10B" target="_blank">seeks to diversify</a> its sources of revenues through investments in renewable energy.

#### Our take

Riyadh's investment is dwarfed by China’s pledge to invest $367 billion in renewables (solar, wind, hydro and nuclear) by 2020. But the elephant in the room is finally moving and that’s a good thing. Even in the winter months, Saudi Arabia gets no less than 200 hours of sunshine per month, and up to 350 hours in the summer. The kingdom not just sits on black gold, it literally walks on sunshine as well. Better channel that strong Arabian sun to cooling down Saudi homes.
