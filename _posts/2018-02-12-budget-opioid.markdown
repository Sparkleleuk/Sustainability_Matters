### Big wins and big losses

The Trump administration today released a $4.4 trillion budget that favored military spending and immigration enforcement, and disenfranchised welfare programs.

#### FTW
<b>Defense</b> spending is proposed to increase by 13% to $716 billion to purchase new ships and jets, as well as new missile defense interceptors and silos. Trump's proposal also includes 2.6% pay raise for troops and $85.5 billion in discretionary funding for veterans health services, education, and vocational rehabilitation. <b>Immigration enforcement</b> is also a clear winner with Trump's $18 billion request to build the wall along the US-Mexican border, one of his key campaign promises. He is requesting $782 million to hire 2,750 new border and immigration officers and $2.7 billion for detention of illegal entrants.

<b>Public health</b> wins with Trump's request for $13 billion in new funding to fight the opioid problem over two years. The Department of Health and Human Services would get $3 billion this year, and $10 billion in 2019. The government quietly renewed a public health emergency declaration in January but did not release federal funds. <b>Infrastructure</b> also gets a boost with $200 billion in federal funds over the next 10 years to entice states, local government and the private sector to finance public infrastructure project.

#### Better luck next time

While Trump wants to fund America's "crumbling infrastructure", he doesn't want to fund <b>Amtrak</b>. Amtrak's budget was slashed by 51% to $783 million. Amtrak has experienced some pretty <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amtrak-train-derailments-recent-list-washington/" target="_blank">bad accidents</a> and with reduced funding, how is it supposed to fix problems? The <b>environment</b> also loses big time with a 25% cut in the Environmental Protection Agency funding. The Department of Interior, which manages natural resources including the National Parks System, is similarly getting reduced funding by 16%. <b>Entitlement and welfare programs</b> are also being cut by $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years. This includes a cut back in funding for Medicare, significant changes in the Medicaid program.

#### What now?

Copies of the budget proposal are now all over the Capitol, but like all White House budget proposals, it is unlikely to go anywhere without Congress doing anything about it. Therefore, there is no reason to panic over the losers, yet. What this document does is clearly signal the priorities of the Trump administration and how the president intends to govern the country for the rest of his term.

### Opiod maker puts a halt on marketing

The maker of OxyContin, an opioid drug, has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/americas-heroin-epidemic/oxycontin-maker-purdue-stop-promoting-opioids-light-epidemic-n846726" target="_blank">announced</a> that it will stop marketing the drug to doctors. Purdue Pharma said it would cut its sales force by more than half as part of a company restructuring. The company sent letters to medical practitioners, saying that its "field sales organization will no longer be visiting your offices to engage you in discussions about our opioid products."

#### What's the angle?

Purdue Pharma has been criticized for aggressively marketing OxyContin to doctors, leading to increased prescriptions of the drug. Ten years ago, the company was <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/19877184/ns/health-health_care/t/oxycontin-maker-execs-fined-million/#.WoI_v5PwZWO" target="_blank">fined $634 million</a> for misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction. The company continues to face lawsuits with the same allegations, including a <a href="http://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/ferguson-new-details-unsealed-lawsuit-against-one-nation-s-largest-opioid" target="_blank">lawsuit filed by Washington state</a> in 2017. OxyContin has been <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html" target="_blank">cited by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention</a> as one of the common drugs that have caused painkiller addiction in the US. But ironically enough, the Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/08/14/fda-approves-oxycontin-kids/31711929/" target="_blank">approved</a> OxyContin for kids in 2015. 

#### Our take

At the rate things are going, Purdue Pharma's decision comes 10 years too late but it's better late than never. Now if only other opioid producers would do the same.
