### US military bases threatened by wild weather

The US Department of Defense (DoD) today released a <a href="https://climateandsecurity.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/tab-b-slvas-report-1-24-2018.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> warning that extreme weather may threaten US military bases in the continental US. The DoD conducted a survey of the effects of extreme weather on military installations and found that approximately 50% of all sites were affected by such weather.  Drought, wind and non-storm surge related flooding caused the most damage to military facilities. Approximately 10% of sites were affected by extreme temperatures, and 6% were affected by flooding due to storm surge and wildfire. Airfield operations, transportation, energy, training facilities and water or wastewater systems were most impacted. “If extreme weather makes our critical facilities unusable or necessitates costly or manpower-intensive workarounds, that is an unacceptable impact,” the DoD <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/31/climate-change-threatens-us-military-bases-pentagon" target="_blank">said</a>.


#### Why is this important?

US military bases are critical to maintaining national security and are home to thousands of servicemen and women in uniform. US military bases are also used as launching pads for rescue and rehabilitation operations in times of natural disasters. If these bases are themselves incapacitated, it hampers the US government's ability to respond to national security threats and natural disasters.

#### Extreme weather threats are not new

In 2012 for example, Hurricane Sandy resulted in $24 million in damages to Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey. High winds, storm surge and intense rain damaged the base's 2.9 mile long pier and destroyed nearly eight miles of water and sewer piping, the DoD said. Twenty-five years ago, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines led to the <a href="https://www.stripes.com/recounting-us-military-s-last-days-in-the-philippines-1.228182" target="_blank">closure</a> of the largest US naval base outside of continental America, which is widely believed to have helped reduce America's influence in the Asia-Pacific.

#### Our take  

The Pentagon report fundamentally opposes President Trump's position that <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/12/18/nss.html" target="_blank">climate change is not a national security threat</a>. But he probably hasn't thought of how  a flooded naval base would look like to the "Little Rocket Man".

### CDC chief owned tobacco stocks

The chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today resigned due to controversy over her ownership of tobacco stocks. Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, a medical doctor, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/30/cdc-director-tobacco-stocks-after-appointment-316245" target="_blank">reportedly</a> bought stocks of tobacco companies shortly after she was appointed CDC head. According to her <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000161-4804-d9fe-a9fd-5af5834d0000" target="_blank">Public Financial Disclosure Report</a> published by Politico, she bought $1,000 to $15,000 worth of shares of Japan Tobacco on August 8, 2017. She was appointed CDC head on July 7, 2017.

#### Why does this matter?

The CDC is one of the federal agencies tasked to promote public health and is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/" target="_blank">lead agency for tobacco prevention and control</a>. If the head of agency owns tobacco stocks, this is one helluva of conflict of interest and undermines the credibility of the agency's anti-smoking campaign.

#### Our take

We suspect Dr. Fitzgerald made a rookie mistake by not paying attention to her investments. But what's clear is she doesn't practice <a href="https://www.ussif.org/sribasics" target="_blank">responsible investing</a>.
