### Global temperature continues to go up, up and away?

Many parts of North America experienced a long winter, with the snow season extending up to April. But it turns out that the rest of the world experienced the stark opposite. April 2018 was the third warmest April in more than a hundred years, while the period between January and April was the fifth warmest. And the world just experienced the 400th straight month of warmer-than-average temperatures.

#### Hit me with details.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a US government scientific agency, <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201804" target="_blank">reported</a> that April 2018 was the warmest April since 1910 in Europe and South America, while it was the second warmest April on record in Australia. It was the ninth warmest April on record in Asia, and in eastern and central Pakistan, temperatures soared to as high as 50C (122F). But meanwhile, many parts of the US and Canada experienced lower than average temperatures. It was the coldest April in the US since 1997.

#### What does this tell us?

NOAA scientists <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/17/weather/earth-warming-400-month-noaa-climate-trnd-wxc/index.html" target="_blank">point to man-made causes</a> because of the consistency in the increase. While natural factors such as El Niño could cause an increase in global temperatures, there would be fluctuations in global temperatures especially from the cooling effect of cyclical weather patterns such as La Niña or volcanic eruptions. But the increase has been consistent, prompting scientists to conclude that this trend could only have been caused by human activity.
As for last month's weather, this explains why we were still wearing winter jackets in early April while our friends in Europe were already running around in their t-shirts.

#### Why does this matter?

Because climate change. Nuff said.
