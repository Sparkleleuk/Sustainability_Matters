### Bonn climate talks end

Climate talks in Bonn ended over the weekend on a lackluster note, although countries agreed to intensify talks about their commitments ahead of the 2020 deadline for reducing carbon emissions (called the Talanoa dialogues). This year's climate talks were marked by lingering support for coal and fossil fuels by some of the world's largest economies. "German Chancellor Angela Merkel told delegates at the meeting that coal would remain a big part of her nationâ€™s energy policy," reported [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-18/climate-envoys-step-up-pace-of-work-without-support-from-trump). The [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42032229) reported that "US coal and nuclear companies organized a presentation here arguing that fossil fuels should a key part of the solution to rising temperatures."

#### Why does this matter?

We are just three years away from 2020, the year that countries agreed to cut emissions to mitigate global warming and yet we are not seeing strong signals that will meet the deadline. The continued support by the US and Germany for coal puts the voluntary commitments at risk. We have already seen carbon emissions [increase](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/06/climate/world-emissions-goals-far-off-course.html) this year, although it is too soon to tell if this increase is a blip or a long-term trend.

#### This may sound depressing but...

There is a silver lining. [China and India](http://climateactiontracker.org/news/287/Improvement-in-warming-outlook-as-India-and-China-move-ahead-but-Paris-Agreement-gap-still-looms-large.html), the other two top emitters, are actually poised to meet their commitments on time or earlier. Aggressive climate policies by both countries have already had an impact on emissions projections.
