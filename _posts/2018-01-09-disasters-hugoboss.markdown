### Natural disasters cost the US more than $300B in 2017

Natural disasters are costly and in 2017 alone, hurricanes and wildfires cost the US $306.2 billion, a record high, <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/overview" target="_blank">according to a government study</a> released on January 8. The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) tracked 16 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each across the country. These events included drought, flooding freeze, severe storms, tropical cyclones and a wildfire event. These resulted in the death of 362 people.

#### What's been the trend?

It's not looking good. The NCEI noted that since 1980, the US experienced 219 events where cost or damage exceeded $1 billion. These events cost the US economy a whopping $1.5 trillion. In the last 37 years, severe storms were the most frequent billion-dollar events (41.6%), followed by tropical cyclones (17.4%). However, tropical cyclones inflicted the most damage, accounting for $850.5 billion (55%) in total cost, followed by droughts that accounted for $236.6 billion (15.4%). Tropical cyclones also accounted for the most deaths (3,461), followed by droughts and heat waves (2,993). The NCEI's tracking showed that the cost of disasters has been steadily increasing since the early 2000s. The NCEI stats can be accessed <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/summary-stats" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Why does this matter?

This matters for obvious reasons: the loss of lives, the impact on the economy, opportunity costs, productivity loss, and other intangible impacts. The figures above do not even consider smaller scale disasters, which cost less than $1 billion but have had significant impact on communities and local economies. If we add the smaller scale disasters, the cost of natural disasters to the US is even higher than what is recorded.

### Hugo Boss discovers forced labor in its supply chain

German luxury clothing brand, Hugo Boss, has found forced labor in at least one of its supplier companies in India. The company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/04/workers-held-captive-indian-mills-supplying-hugo-boss" target="_blank">found that young female migrant workers were held captive</a> in garment factories in southern India, which were owned by Best Corporation, also a supplier to other high street brands. The company said it has been in "regular contact and intensive exchange" with the supplier and both are working "on changes together".""

#### Why is this important?

Many clothing brands use manufacturing facilities in South Asia to minimize the cost of production, allowing them to aggressively compete in the tough clothing retail market. But the drive to cut costs  comes with a steep price. The <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22476774" target="_blank">2013 Rana Plaza collapse</a>, which killed more than 1,000 garment workers, underscored the social costs of pushing suppliers to produce more for less money. Suppliers who are pushed to produce more are also driven to cut corners and push their workers to their limits. While many clothing brands have strengthened their supply chain policies and programs, cases of labor violations continue to pop up, which shows that managing suppliers and making them adhere to international labor standards is no easy task. Meanwhile, we might be wearing clothes manufactured in these sweatshops and we don't even know it.

A <a href="http://www.mightyearth.org/burned/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=&stream=top-stories" target="_blank">report pointing to "massive" deforestation</a> in the Argentina as a result of the US' biofuels policy. Argentina provides about a fifth of biodiesel consumed in the US, and the demand from its northern neighbor is driving the clearing of forests to make way for soy production. This looks like an environmental disaster waiting to happen. Bump!
