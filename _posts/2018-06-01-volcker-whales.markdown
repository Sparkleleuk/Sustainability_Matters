### Reduced restrictions, more risk

The US Congress and Federal Reserve are preparing to relax regulations imposed eight years ago to prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis. Among the changes are the lifting of capital restrictions on small- and medium-sized banks and softening of restrictions on complex trading activities by investment banks.

#### Too small to regulate

Earlier this week, the US House of Representatives voted 258-159 to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/business/congress-passes-dodd-frank-rollback-for-smaller-banks.html" target="_blank">soften the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act of 2010</a>. Among the provisions that was approved to be rolled back were capital requirements for small- to medium-sized banks. These regs were imposed on banks to enable them to withstand losses from a sudden economic downturn without having to ask taxpayers to bail them out. But legislators now believe that small and medium-sized banks do not need to be subjected to the same level of capital oversight as large banks because their impact on the economy is not as significant as the bigger banks.

#### Green light on risky business

The Federal Reserve is also preparing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/business/volcker-rule-banks-federal-reserve.html" target="_blank">relax restrictions</a> on banks to engage in complex trading activities. The Fed said that while the Volcker Rule (the Dodd-Frank provision that covers risky activities) will continue to restrict proprietary trading, banks will be allowed to engage in other trading activities and determine their own risk thresholds.

#### Why do these matter?

Because restrictions were imposed on the financial industry for good reason: banks caused a global economic meltdown that affected just about everybody in America and beyond. But since the law was passed in 2010, banks have been lobbying hard to have it loosened and it finally worked. Legislators say lifting the restrictions will simplify regulatory compliance and will have positive economic impact. For example, lifting the capital restriction on small and medium-sized banks will release more funds for lending. History will judge if this rollback was the right call. Otherwise, see you when the next crisis hits.

**ICYMI**

#### **Killing Expedition**

Japan's annual whaling expedition that ended in March <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/05/31/national/122-pregnant-minke-whales-killed-controversial-japanese-whale-hunt-report/#.WxMOc1MvxWM" target="_blank">killed 122 pregnant minke whales</a>. A report submitted by Japanese authorities to the International Whaling Commission noted the the pregnant minke whales were among 333 whales killed in the four-month expedition. Tokyo says the expedition is for "scientific research" but everyone knows that whale meat is served in dinner tables as a local delicacy. Thanks but no thanks, we're not hungry.
