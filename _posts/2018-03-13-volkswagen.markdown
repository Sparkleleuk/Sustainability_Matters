### More cobalt please

Volkswagen will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/vw-secures-25-billion-battery-supplies-in-electric-car-surge" target="_blank">increase the production of electric cars</a> and has secured EUR 20 billion worth of battery supplies to start ramping up production. The German car manufacturer plans to buy a total of $50 billion worth of batteries from a number of Asian suppliers to produce electric cars from 16 factories (it has three factories currently) by 2022.

#### Why does this matter?

Electric cars are the wave of the not-so-distant future and virtually all car makers are starting to develop and market their own models. The growth of electric cars and smartphones is pushing the demand for cobalt, the main component of batteries that power these products. Cobalt is being mined in a <a href="https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/mcs-2017-cobal.pdf" target="_blank">number of countries</a> including Australia, Cuba, the Philippines, Russia, and Zambia but the Democratic Republic of Congo, by far, holds the largest cobalt reserves in the world. It is estimated to hold 60% of the world’s supply. Cobalt is not among the common <a href="https://www.sec.gov/opa/Article/2012-2012-163htm---related-materials.html" target="_blank">conflict minerals</a> but mining it comes with its own <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/" target="_blank">environmental and social baggage</a>. <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/11/industry-giants-fail-to-tackle-child-labour-allegations-in-cobalt-battery-supply-chains/" target="_blank">Amnesty International says</a> small cobalt miners use children, while companies using cobalt have not done enough to stop child labor.  

#### Our take

Supply chain risks are real and companies that source significant amounts of minerals can be held responsible for the environmental damage caused by the mineral extraction and/or the poor working conditions around these activities. This was how conflict minerals became regulated and became part of the Dodd-Frank Act. Amnesty International, in its November 2017 report, says car manufacturers have, at best, taken “moderate action” to address child labor in cobalt mines. Volkswagen has taken “minimal” action. Everyone agrees electric cars are cool, but with coolness comes great responsibility.

#### **Quote of the day: From beauty to the beast**

<em>Everything is done through Facebook in Myanmar. It was used to convey public messages but we know that the ultra-nationalist Buddhists have their own Facebooks [sic] and are really inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya or other ethnic minorities. I’m afraid that Facebook has now turned into a beast, and not what it [was] originally intended.</em> - Yanghee Lee, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. UN investigators agree that Facebook played a crucial role in the violence against the Rohingya. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-facebook/u-n-investigators-cite-facebook-role-in-myanmar-crisis-idUSKCN1GO2PN" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
