### Survey shows people don't trust social media anymore

A new <a href="https://www.edelman.com/sites/default/files/2018-06/2018_Trust_Barometer_Brands_Social_Media_Special_Full_Report.pdf" target="_blank">global survey</a> by public relations firm Edelman showed that social media has become the least trusted form of media globally. The 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer showed that traditional media are still trusted while search engines are also starting to be mistrusted, although not in the same level as social media.

#### Hit me with the details

Globally, only 41% of the respondents trust social media in 2018. The biggest decline was recorded in the US where trust in social media dropped by 11%. The same decline was recorded in the US for search engines. Trust in traditional media, meanwhile, was recorded at 66%, with most of countries seeing an increase.

#### Why the loss of trust?

The decline in trust is attributed to social media's failure to protect users against identity theft, cyberbullying and hate speech, and fake news among other factors. Most of the respondents believe that social media must be pressured to protect users against fake news and harmful content, as well as ensure that personal data is protected and used ethically.

#### Why does this matter?

Because social media's business model is largely built on public trust, and now social media companies are losing it. The question is, how does a social media company survive the loss of the ingredient that makes its business model possible?

**ICYMI**

#### **Audi CEO arrested**

The CEO of Audi, the car company, has been <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/transport-and-tourism/audi-ceo-arrested-over-diesel-cheating-scandal-1.3534581" target="_blank">arrested in Munich</a>, over his role in the 2015 dieselgate scandal in Volkswagen. Police are investigating whether Rupert Stadler knew about the manipulation of emissions testing results in Audi's parent company. He was reportedly arrested over concerns that he may try to get rid of evidence. It's been three years since Volkswagen was caught manipulating emissions tests in the US, but the fallout continues. Goes to show how ethical misconduct has far-reaching consequences.
