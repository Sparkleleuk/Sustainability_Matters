### Iceland law mandates equal pay regardless of gender. Boom.

It is now officially illegal to pay Arnaldson more than Arnalddottir. A gender parity law that was enacted in March last year took effect on January 1st, making Iceland the first country in the world to officially require private and public entities to pay their workers equally regardless of gender and ethnicity for that matter. The law covers the public sector as well as businesses that employ more than 25 workers. They will need a certification from a government agency that they are paying male and female staff the same salary for the same type of jobs.

#### So what's the back story?

There is long-ish <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/document/activities/cont/201107/20110725ATT24624/20110725ATT24624EN.pdf" target="_blank">background</a> that dates back to 1975 when gender equality first became a policy in Iceland. This policy eventually evolved into the Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights of Women and Men enacted in 2008. Iceland's gender equality act also covers maternal and paternal leave benefits as well as representation of women in government councils (at least 40% of seats must be held by women), and corporate boardrooms. Note that the percentage of women in boardrooms has not increased but that's another story.

#### Can we copy this in America?

We can and we already have the tools to do make this happen. We have the <a href="https://nwlc.org/resources/lilly-ledbetter-fair-pay-act/" target="_blank">Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009</a>, outlaws pay discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, race, national origin, religion, and disability. In 2016, President Obama signed <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/29/fact-sheet-new-steps-advance-equal-pay-seventh-anniversary-lilly" target="_blank">an executive order</a> requiring the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to collect pay data from businesses with more than 100 employees. Shareholders, through shareholder resolutions, have also increased demands for companies to voluntarily disclose pay data. A growing number of companies, especially in tech, have started to be transparent about salaries and are working to close the gap. But some, such as <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/us-banks-are-behind-the-global-curve-on-gender-pay-equity" target="_blank">big banks</a>, are still holding out.

#### Our take

Gender pay parity is totally doable, but because its been such a tough sell to corporate America, achieving it will take waaaaay longer than in Iceland.

### China says no to less fuel efficient cars

China is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/climate/china-cars-pollution.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0" target="_blank">suspending the production of more than 500 cars models</a> that do not meet its fuel economy standards, in yet another effort to cut emissions. The suspension covers car production by both domestic companies and foreign ventures, and took effect on January 1st.

#### Why is this important?

While this ban will affect just 1% of the Chinese auto market, it sends out yet another strong signal that China is serious about cutting pollution and reducing emissions. Heck, its even willing to accept <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/12/26/china-growth.html" target="_blank">lower economic growth</a> to tackle pollution.

#### Our take

China has been a heavy carbon emitter, but it is now doing a lot of heavy lifting to reduce its footprint. Thumbs up for the effort.

A <a href="http://www.cta.tech/cta/media/policyImages/policyPDFs/Energy-Consumption-of-Consumer-Electronics-in-U-S-Homes-in-2017.pdf" target="_blank">new report on the energy consumption of electronics</a> in American households last year. American households are actually use less electronics, which means their gadgets are using less energy. Imagine that.
