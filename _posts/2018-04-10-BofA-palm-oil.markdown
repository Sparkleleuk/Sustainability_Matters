### Bank of America pulls the plug on lending to assault rifle makers

Bank of America, the country's biggest bank, announced that it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-10/bofa-will-no-longer-lend-to-some-gunmakers-vice-chairman-says" target="_blank">would stop lending</a> to companies that manufacture assault-style firearms for civilian use. Anne Finucane, a vice chairman at Bank of America, said the firm has had “intense conversations over the last few months” with these type of manufacturers over the bank's decision not to finance their operations in the future. The bank has also decided not to underwrite securities issued by manufacturers of military-style guns used by civilians.

#### Who's happy, who's not?

Gun control advocates, such as the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, are happy, while the The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry lobby, is not.  The NSSF indicated it wants further discussions with Bank of America on how to preventing the use of firearms by those that should not have them.  

#### Why does this matter?

Bank of America is the second major bank that is imposing restrictions on the gun industry following the February 14 Parkland, Florida mass shooting. Citigroup earlier announced that it will <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/human%20rights/environment/2018/03/22/citi.html" target="_blank">prohibit retailers</a> from offering bump stocks or selling guns to people who have not passed a background check or are younger than 21 years old. Such actions carry weight because banks provide access to short-term capital that businesses often need.

### British supermarket says no to palm oil

The Iceland supermarket chain said it will ban palm oil from all its brand products, noting that there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil. The company's managing director, Richard Walker, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43696948" target="_blank">said certified sustainable palm oil</a> does not limit deforestation, or the growth of palm oil plantation. "So until such a time as there is genuinely sustainable palm oil that contains zero deforestation, we are saying no to palm oil," he said.

#### The pledge

Iceland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/10/iceland-to-be-first-uk-supermarket-to-cut-palm-oil-from-own-brand-products?CMP=fb_gu" target="_blank">committed</a> that 100% of its brand food lines will be 100% palm oil-free by 2018. The company is looking at 130 products, representing 10% of its brand food products. The company hopes to reduce demand for palm oil by more than 500 tonnes per year. Iceland said it has worked with suppliers to replace palm oil with substitutes such as rapeseed and vegetable oils.

#### What about the RSPO?

Most Western retailers and food companies look to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) for guidance on palm oil sourcing, and only source RSPO-certified palm oil. The RSPO has a set of environmental and social criteria that palm oil companies must meet to be certified sustainable. Among the key <a href="https://rspo.org/about/sustainable-palm-oil" target="_blank">RSPO criteria</a> are the protection of primary forests, areas with significant concentrations of diversity or fragile ecosystems; a significant reduction in the use of pesticides and fires; fair labor treatment; and community consultations for new plantations.

#### Why does this matter?

The demand for palm oil has been blamed for <a href="http://www.wri.org/blog/2017/07/drivers-deforestation-indonesia-inside-and-outside-concessions-areas" target="_blank">high rates of deforestation</a> in Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, and is threatening some animal species, such as the orangutan. Deforestation, of course, contributes to global warming. Moreover, the clearing of massive tracts of land for palm oil plantations causes high levels of air pollution and smog in Southeast Asia.
