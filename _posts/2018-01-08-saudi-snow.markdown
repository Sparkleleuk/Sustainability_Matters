### Financial sector itching for a piece of Saudi Aramco IPO pie

The world's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, is preparing to go public and has the financial world in a frenzy. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-08/goldman-citi-are-said-to-be-in-lead-for-top-roles-in-aramco-ipo" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> today that two US financial services firms, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, are likely to be named managers of what is expected to become the world's biggest IPO (initial public offering). JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and Morgan Stanley are also expected to be named global coordinators. The Saudi government, which owns Aramco, is planning to sell just 5% of the company's shares but the IPO is expected to make some serious money. The kingdom wants to use the IPO proceeds to set up a sovereign wealth fund to finance future state expenditures.

#### First, let's do the math

Banks are reportedly valuing Aramco at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion while the government values it at $2 trillion. Under this valuation range, the IPO would be valued at between $50 billion and $75 billion and a high of $100 billion based on the government valuation. These amounts are way higher than the IPO of the Chinese technology company, Alibaba, which raised $21.8 billion in 2014, the largest IPO to date. Thus, the Aramco IPO will be huge. And this is why banks are salivating to underwrite it. Underwriters make money from underwriting fees. They also make money by buying up the shares before they are sold in the stock exchange and profiting from the sale of the shares in the secondary market. If a stock is hot, the underwriters go home rich and happy.

#### Why does this matter?

This matters because if the IPO goes ahead and the shares list internationally, there is a good chance that we will end up invested in the company through our pension funds, mutual funds and other investments. Unless our investment manager excludes oil and gas companies from their portfolios, many of us are likely to have some form of exposure to this stock. Therefore, we should be concerned about how this company intends to run itself, ensure sustainable operations, and manage future risks. Moreover, Aramco's oil production level also makes it a major carbon emitter in the industry. We should be concerned about how the company plans to reduce its carbon footprint and how it plans to manage looming climate risks. 

#### What should we keep an eye on?

Aramco has been called out by transparency advocates for being "opaque". In <a href="https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/documents/2017-resource-governance-index.pdf" target="_blank">an analysis and ranking of state-run oil companies by the National Resource Governance Institute</a>, Aramco scored lower than many other state-run firms due to inadequate transparency on its reserves, revenues, taxes, operational costs, and business practices. The orientation of the <a href="https://resourcegovernance.org/blog/float-or-not-float-aramco-ipo-bellwether-state-owned-enterprise-governance" target="_blank">company's management</a> is also under scrutiny. It appears that Aramco's level of transparency is not up to international standards, yet.

#### How can Aramco be compelled to be transparent?

Underwriters have a responsibility to make sure that companies going public are disclosing data that is important for investors to determine if the company is a solid investment. Stock exchanges are also responsible for enforcing listing rules and right now, it's a toss between the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.

**BEFORE YOU GO**

#### **We've been reading**

A <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/03/1711234115" target="_blank">new report</a> pointing out that US river systems have greater salinity (read: getting more salty) while becoming less acidic. This may be in part due to the heavy of road salt during the winter. More salt used on roads and sidewalks, means more salt goes into our water systems.
