### Harassment claims dog Trump

At least three women claiming to have been harassed by President Trump today urged the US Congress to investigate him for inappropriate behavior before he was president. The three are among [multiple women](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/nov/30/donald-trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-full-list) who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. They came out with their allegations in the 2016 presidential campaign but their claims were dismissed. At least 56 female lawmakers today [wrote](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/364387-nearly-60-female-lawmakers-call-for-probe-into-sexual-allegations-against) a letter to the House Oversight Committee to open an investigation. The White House has [denied](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/27/donald-trump-sexual-harassment-claims-women-lying-white-house) the allegations.

#### How important is this?

Very important. Allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against a sitting president are certainly exceptional. What is more critical at this stage, however, is how Congress reacts. Will Congress heed the victims' call and carry out an investigation? It has not responded yet but it sure is between a rock and a hard place on sexual misconduct.

#### Option 1: Investigate Trump

If it agrees to investigate Trump, it will have to deal with [other legislators](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/364025-congress-reeling-from-sexual-harassment-deluge) who have been accused of sexual harassment but remain in office. And with Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore being endorsed by many Republicans despite facing similar allegations, an investigation into Trump will leave Congress in a very uncomfortable position.

#### Option 2: Ignore

If it ignores the Trump accusers, Congress risks severe criticism of impunity as well as absence of moral compass. Not that Congress has any more to lose (because its [job approval rating](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx) has pretty much tanked). But failure to act will have long-term implications on women's rights. It will show that government has no accountability and puts politics over women's rights.

#### Why does sexual harassment matter?

Sexual harassment is a women's rights issue, and women's rights are human rights. Sexual harassment has significant impact on the psychological and emotional well-being of the victims, violating their basic human right to health and safety. In simpler terms, women have the right to live, work and play the same way as men do, but sexual harassment curtails this right and puts women's safety at risk.

#### I'm a man, why should I care?

Because you wouldn't want to have your mother treated this way, would you?

#### **What we've been watching**

National Geographic's [video of a starving polar bear](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/12/polar-bear-starving-arctic-sea-ice-melt-climate-change-spd/) in Baffin Island is difficult to watch, but the message is loud and clear. This is what climate change looks like, and it's not pretty.

The Washington Post's video on how [trash is disposed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/global-waste/?utm_term=.4c89e6241a51) in six different countries. We produce 3.5 million tons of trash, and it is drowning the world.
