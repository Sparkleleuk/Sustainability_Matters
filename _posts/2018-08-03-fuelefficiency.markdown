### The EPA's proposal to freeze gas mileage standards

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rolled out a plan to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-administration-seeks-freeze-gas-mileage-standards-cars/story?id=56985530" target="_blank">suspend fuel emission standards</a> for cars built after 2020 for five years. This reverses the Obama-era policy that requires the automobile industry to manufacture cares that averaged 35 miles to a gallon in 2020 and up to 50 miles per gallon by 2025.

#### Why does the EPA want to do this?

The EPA and the Department of Transportation say that the fuel efficiency standards have made cars more expensive, forcing people to continue driving older cars that may make roads less safe. In April, then EPA chief Scott Pruitt said the standards are "too stringent" and that they present "challenges to auto manufacturers due to feasibility and practicability."

#### And critics are not happy

Environmental groups say that the new policy will increase pollution and increase personal spending on gas. At least 19 states that have instituted their own fuel standards warned that they will sue the federal government if the plan goes through.

#### Why does this matter?

Because climate change matters. In 2016, the transportation sector accounted for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank">28% of GHG emissions in the US</a>, matching the utility sector. The share of transportation grew from 27% in 2015, while the utility sector's share fell from 29%. Yep, there is an upward trend for transportation  and suspending fuel emission standards is not going to help.
