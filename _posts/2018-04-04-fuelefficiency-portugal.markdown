### US mayors, attorneys to challenge withdrawal of fuel efficiency rules

Attorneys and mayors from more than 25 US states said they will challenge the Trump administration's withdrawal of fuel efficiency rules. The <a href="https://www.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/28/2018/04/Local-Leaders-Clean-Car-Declaration.pdf" target="_blank">Local Leaders' Clean Car Declaration</a> stated that the signatories support the current federal standards, and that they are "appropriate" in light of the negative health impacts of pollution and the "severe impacts" posed by climate change.

#### And they shalt resist

The mayors and attorneys said they "strongly oppose and will vigorously resist any effort by the Administration to prevent states from enforcing reasonable, commonsense emissions performance standards for vehicle fleets sold in their jurisdictions". They said they will use their market power and regulatory authority to ensure compliance with the fuel efficiency rules.

#### Why does this matter?

This is one of those cases where a federal executive decision ends up symbolic because local governments won't enforce them. States enforce federal rules, but if they disagree with the rules, then Washington has a problem. States have been opposing decisions by the Trump government on environmental issues. Last year, mayors from 50 US cities <a hrefe="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/12/09/mayor-agreement.html" target="_blank">agreed to stick to the Paris Agreement</a>, in defiance of President Trump's plan to take the US out of the Agreement. The decision to withdraw the Obama-era fuel efficiency rules was going to pit the federal government against California, whose fuel efficiency rules exceed the federal level. Looks like its not just California that the White House has to worry about.

**ICYMI**

#### **Portugal's renewable energy production in March exceeded demand**

Portugal produced 103.6% of mainland electricity consumption from renewable energy in March. This is the first time in four decades that Portugal's renewable energy production exceeded local demand. Hydroelectric dams accounted for 55% of consumption in March, while wind power accounted for 42%. Dams were refilled by higher than average rainfall during that month. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/portugal-energy-renewables/portugal-looks-to-renewables-as-march-output-tops-mainland-power-demand-idUSL5N1RG35T" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
