### New Zealand ends offshore oil drilling

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern today announced that her government will <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/planning-future-no-new-offshore-oil-and-gas-exploration-permits" target="_blank">stop issuing new licenses</a> for offshore oil and gas drilling as part of its goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. The government will allow the existing 22 active offshore permits covering 38,000 square to run until their expiration, and could be converted into mining permits that could extend for another 40 years.

#### Some are not happy…

The oil and gas industry is not happy, and so is the local government Taranaki, where most offshore oil and gas fields are based. The Petroleum Exploration & Production Association New Zealand said <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/12/new-zealand-set-to-ban-oil-and-gas-drilling.html" target="_blank">there should have been consultations</a> before the decision was made and the New Zealand Oil and Gas Company said it has not been made aware of the policy which it considered to contradict pre-election promises. The opposition National Party said the decision was “economic vandalism” and does not make environmental sense. The mayor of New Plymouth, the largest city in Taranaki, said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/world/asia/new-zealand-ban-oil-drilling.html" target="_blank">the decision is “a kick in the guts”</a> for the regional economy” and signals to Taranaki’s major investors that they “do not have a long-term future in New Zealand.”

#### Why does this matter?

The local petroleum industry <a href="http://www.pepanz.com/dmsdocument/16" target="_blank">estimates</a> that New Zealand is potentially rich in offshore oil and gas. There are 17 sedimentary basins surrounding the country, which have possible commercial quantities of oil and gas, but only one basin, Taranaki, has been explored and developed. There has also been a drop in exploration in recent years due to the drop in oil prices, and the industry expects gas supply to start dwindling by 2020. New Zealand has effectively put a cap on developing all the other sediment basins at the risk of spending more for imports. New Zealand imports oil for energy use, but is one of the highest users of renewable energy. It <a href="https://www.eeca.govt.nz/energy-use-in-new-zealand/renewable-energy-resources/" target="_blank">sourced 40%</a> of its total energy from renewable sources in 2015.

### Four more countries face a dry future

A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/11/day-zero-water-crises-spain-morocco-india-and-iraq-at-risk-as-dams-shrink?CMP=fb_gu" target="_blank">pilot project</a> that aims to track water supply in approximately 500,000 dams all over the world, indicate that water supply in four countries is at risk of being depleted sooner than later. Morocco, Spain, Iraq and India experienced significant declines in water supply in major dams, which may spark a crisis similar to that currently experienced in South Africa.

#### Let’s start with Morocco…

Water supply in Morocco’s second-largest reservoir, Al Massira, has dropped by 60% in the three years due to recurring drought, expanding irrigation, and increased usage by nearby cities, according to the World Resources Institute, which is part of the group involved in the project. The dam’s water level is at its lowest level in a decade. The level of decline in Al Massira’s water level is the worst among the four countries.

#### What about the others?

Water supply in Spain's Buendia dam has also declined by 60% in the last five years, due a severe drought. Spain has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/08/spain-drought-farmers-climate-change-extremadura" target="_blank">dry for six years now</a>, impacting agriculture. Buendia dam is located on the Tagus River in Guadalajara. The water level in India’s Indira Sagar dam is a third of its seasonal average, while Iraq’s Mosul Dam is also down by 60% from its peak in the 1990s, contributing to conflict and people displacement.

#### Our take

The report confirms trends towards increased stress in the global water supply. And water is considered the next flashpoint that may drive conflict and large-scale displacement. South Africa has been in the news because of Cape Town’s <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/csr/human%20rights/2018/01/19/CapeTown-Canada.htm" target="_blank">Zero Day threat</a>, but other countries are facing the same dry future.
