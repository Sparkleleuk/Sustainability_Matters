### Senate bill extends renewable energy tax credits

Left out by the December 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, renewable energy sources are getting extensions in tax credits for at least two more years in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/senate-spending-bill-taxes-medicare.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news" target="_blank">new Senate bill</a>. Tax credits for geothermal, small wind farms and fuel, along with wind and solar power, are being extended until 2020, afterwhich they start to phase out. The bill extends an existing production tax credit for nuclear power past 2020. The bill also expands a tax credit for carbon capture companies. These are companies that capture carbon dioxide from polluting facilities like power plants and pump it to underground storage facilities, like old wells.

#### Are there more?

The bill extends a tax credit for expenditures on mine rescue training costs, and allows the immediate deduction of a company's investment in mine safety equipment. But the Senate also extends a 23.8% tax rate for gains from timber sales, lower than the typical 35% rate.

#### What is this new bill?

The Senate spending bill is currently being negotiated to avoid another government shutdown. The GOP and the Dems have been unable to agree on a next year's budget, forcing a federal government shutdown. If the bill passes, then the USG will reopen for business per normal.

#### So why does this issue matter?

Because tax credits help grow renewable energy and help diversify energy sources. Without tax credits, many of these companies may go out of business and renewable energy becomes even less competitive than fossil fuels.

### California plans to resist offshore drilling

California has <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/offshore-drilling-california-2532462495.html" target="_blank">vowed</a> to resist offshore drilling by preventing the transport and processing of oil drilled offshore to the state. The state said it will not approve permits for pipelines that would transport the oil from the offshore drilling rig to their refineries onshore. Moreover, it would subject the construction of new onshore infrastructure by oil companies to a vote in coastal cities and counties.

#### What is this about?

The Trump administration is <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2018/01/04/offshore-drilling.html" target="_blank">proposing</a> to revive offshore drilling in all coastal areas in the US. The proposal, while popular with the oil and gas industry, is opposed by coastal states due to the potential environmental risks associated with offshore drilling. Remember the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010? It's fresh in the minds of state governors and nobody wants that accident in their backyard.

#### Why does this matter?

California's plan may just be the blueprint for resisting offshore drilling. If states do not allow pipelines or new infrastructure onshore, then Trump's grand plan to drill, baby, drill, won't really work, won't it?

**BEFORE YOU GO**

#### **Quote of the day: "Global warming is not necessarily a bad thing"**

<em>"No one disputes that the climate changes, is changing. We see that, it's constant. We obviously contribute to it, we live in the climate, right? So our activity contributes to the climate changing to a certain degree. Now measuring that with precision is, I think, more challenging than is let on at times. But I think the bigger question is what you asked in the very end. Is it an existential threat? Is it something that is unsustainable? Or what kind of effect or harm is this going to have. We know that humans have most flourished during times of what? Warming trends. So I think there's assumptions made that because the climate is warming that that necessarily is a bad thing. Do we really know what the ideal surface temperature is in 2100 in 2018?" </em> ~ Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/scott-pruitt-climate-change-2532424794.html" target="_blank">Hear it to believe it</a>.
