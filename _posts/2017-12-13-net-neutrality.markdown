**NET NEUTRALITY UPDATE**

### Fake comments drive FCC vote

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman today said that at least 2 million public comments sent to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on its plan to repeal net neutrality rules are fake. In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/AGSchneiderman/status/941025240129441792), Schneiderman also called on the FCC to delay tomorrow's scheduled vote in light of evidence that comments were made from stolen identities of Americans. He noted that some comments were from relatives who had passed away or from elderly veterans. Schneiderman also noted that the FCC has refused to cooperate with the investigation.

#### Why does this matter?

The FCC is scheduled to vote to repeal net neutrality rules tomorrow, December 14. The FCC sought public feedback on its plan to repeal and went ahead with the vote on the basis that the public was supportive of the plan. However, the revelation that at least 2 million comments were fake indicates that premise for the vote is flawed. It's entirely possible that there weren't as many commenters who are in favor of the repeal.

#### Our stand

We are not a fan of this plan for [reasons we have pointed out in the past](http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/privacy/csr/2017/11/21/throttled.html). For one, repealing net neutrality rules will disadvantage sites like this, which have no resources to compete again more established media companies. And as subscribers, we hate the idea that internet service providers can essentially control what we can access. The repeal of net neutrality is a triumph for the telecommunications industry and a loss for customers.

### Investor power in One Planet Summit

A group of 225 global investors with a combined assets under management of $26.3 trillion has pledged to closely keep an eye on the heaviest corporate emitters of carbon. At the close of the [One Planet Summit](https://www.oneplanetsummit.fr/en/) in Paris on December 12, the investor group, which included one of largest pension funds in the US, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, said it will publish an annual assessment of how these companies are reducing emissions. Companies that refuse to cooperate will face [increased pressure](https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL8N1OC3SM) through public statements and shareholder resolutions.  

#### This is a big deal, really

$26 trillion in assets is a lot of money, and these may even include our 401Ks and pensions. This means that our savings are helping improve corporate behavior to minimize climate change. Such is the power of investors that even Exxon Mobil, known to have [backed climate denials](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/climate/exxon-global-warming-science-study.html?_r=0), finally [agreed to consider a proposal](http://www.pionline.com/article/20171212/ONLINE/171219920/exxon-mobil-agrees-to-disclose-climate-change-risk-on-company) by a group of large pension funds to disclose its exposure to climate risk. The investor proposal [received 62% of shareholders' vote](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12122017/exxon-climate-risk-disclosure-sec-shareholder-investigation-pressure) in the company's annual shareholders' meeting in May. Exxon Mobil [disclosed](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000003408817000057/r8k121117.htm) that it will enhance its regulatory reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission by including "energy demand sensitivities, implications of two degree Celsius scenarios, and positioning for a lower-carbon future."

#### What else happened in Paris?

The World Bank Group also [announced](http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/12/12/world-bank-group-announcements-at-one-planet-summit) that except in rare cases, it will stop funding oil and gas exploration projects starting 2019. The exception to the rule is financing in "the poorest countries where there is a clear benefit in terms of energy access for the poor and the project fits within the countriesâ€™ Paris Agreement commitments." The Bank will also increase funding for climate change mitigation through green bonds and loans to help countries reduce carbon emissions.
