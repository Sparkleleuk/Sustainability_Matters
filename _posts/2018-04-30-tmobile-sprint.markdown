### T-Mobile and Sprint to merge  

Telecommunications giants T-Mobile and Sprint have <a href="
http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/29/news/companies/t-mobile-sprint-merger/index.html" target="_blank">agreed to merge</a>. Finally. After years of talks and breakups even. The deal is valued at more than $26 billion, one of the largest corporate mergers this year.  T-Mobile CEO, John Legere, will lead the merged company. The flamboyant T-Mobile chief said the merged entity plans to deliver the “highest capacity network in US history”.

#### What happens now?

The merged entity will become the second largest telecommunications firm, after Verizon. It would control about 100 million subscribers. The number of wireless companies in the US, effectively shrinks from four players to three. But, hold on, the merger is still subject to regulatory approval and this takes time.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oligopoly.asp" target="_blank">oligopoly</a>. AKA market concentration. This is usually bad news for consumers because less competition means higher prices and less innovation. Legere has, however, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/30/what-the-t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-means-for-you/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f5dbe0689361" target="_blank">promised</a> 5G and lower prices for consumers. T-Mobile indeed, has a track record of undercutting competition by offering attractive services compared to Verizon and AT&T so it remains to be seen if he can deliver on his promise.

The Australian government has allocated <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/30/asia/australia-great-barrier-reef-protection-intl/index.html?utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&utm_campaign=3d4cf5d49a-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_04_30&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_6da287d761-3d4cf5d49a-83843825" target="_blank">$500 million</a> to save the Great Barrier Reef, the biggest budget it has allocated for reef conservation. The GBR is the world's largest reef and one of Australia's natural treasures.
