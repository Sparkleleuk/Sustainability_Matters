### Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase aim to disrupt healthcare industry

Three corporate giants, technology company Amazon, insurance provider (think Geico) Berkshire Hathaway, and investment bank JPMorgan Chase have agreed to come together to provide low-cost healthcare services to its employees. The three companies are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-and-jpmorgan-chase-to-partner-on-us-employee-health-care.html" target="_blank">planning</a> to launch an independent operation that is "free from profit-making incentives" and that "the initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."

#### What does this mean?

For better or for worse, this partnership is a BFD. The three companies employ approximately 1.1 million people and if their experiment succeeds, they certainly have the resources and the market power to scale and disrupt America's (cliche alert) "broken healthcare system". And if the partnership is able to meaningfully lower healthcare costs, then the Grammy is in the bag. The healthcare industry felt the tremors of a potential disruption. Share prices of major healthcare companies such as CVS and Express Scripts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/30/unitedhealth-cvs-plunge-on-bezos-buffett-and-dimon-plan-to-improve-u-s-health-care.html" target="_blank">dropped</a> on the announcement.

#### Our take

Whatever shakes the healthcare industry is welcome news. We can't wait to see what this trio is up to and what it can accomplish.


#### But there's another angle...

This partnership puts Amazon in the realm of critical industries. When you're one of the dominant technology giants and is grabbing market share from retailers, entry to healthcare makes you too big  and too powerful. Before you know it, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-20/should-america-s-tech-giants-be-broken-up" target="_blank">calls to regulate and break up dominant market players</a> will become louder. Amazon may be in for more regulatory headaches than it bargained for.
