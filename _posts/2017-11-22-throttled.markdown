**Net neutrality rules at risk**

The chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced on November 21 that the Commission plans to [repeal](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/fcc-net-neutrality.html) net neutrality rules, a set of rules that ensure equal access of web content regardless of fees paid by the user, or of internet service provider. FCC chairman Ajit Pai said the federal government "will stop micromanaging the internet". The FCC will require internet service providers to [disclose](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-exclusive/u-s-fcc-chief-plans-to-ditch-u-s-net-neutrality-rules-idUSKBN1DL21A?utm_source=WTF+Just+Happened+Today%3F&utm_campaign=92e576e32c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_11_15_2017&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9813b73b1a-92e576e32c-166133257) their rules for blocking access. The proposal is scheduled to be deliberated by the five-member Commission on December 14.

*Why should we care?*

If the repeal is passed, it will mark the end of the internet as we know it. In the US, which is dominated by a handful of service providers, companies like Verizon and Comcast can, in theory, block or reduce access to certain websites unless content owners or subscribers pay higher fees. Price structures will be affected as service providers will be free to charge subscribers additional fees for in-demand content (say, Netflix or Facebook). Or they can charge premium content owners (like YouTube or Amazon) higher fees to get access to more bandwidth.  Meanwhile, small businesses and startups will be severely disadvantaged, and so will low-income subscribers.

*Who wins?*

The telecom industry. The rest of us lose.

***IT'S A SECRET...***

**Uber was hacked, and didn't tell anyone**

Uber [admitted](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/2016-data-incident/) on November 21 that in late 2016, "two individuals outside the company" stole personal information of approximately 57 million Uber users, including 600,000 drivers. Uber said hackers stole names, addresses and phone numbers of customers, and driver's license information. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he "recently learned" of the data breach and that the company is notifying drivers whose data was stolen and providing them with free credit monitoring and identity theft protection, among other actions.

*You know this matters, don't you?*

If you are or have been an Uber user, this should concern you. The theft of customer and driver data is worrisome in itself, but that it took Uber one year to disclose it makes the breach even worse. It makes you wonder about the extent of the damage and the company's readiness to plug cybersecurity holes. It also makes you wonder, *what other skeletons can the company be hiding in its closet?*

Uber has been rocked by [one scandal after the other](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/05/technology/uber-crises/index.html?iid=EL). Female workers have accused the company of tolerating sexual harassment, opening a pandora's box of gender-related issues in Silicon Valley. Then its former CEO, Travis Kalanick, was discovered to have written ["sex rules"](https://www.recode.net/2017/6/8/15765514/2013-miami-letter-uber-ceo-kalanick-employees-sex-rules-company-celebration) for a company party in 2013. Then, it was investigated for using its Greyball software to evade regulators. Then, it was embroiled in a dispute with Google over alleged theft of Google's self-driving cars.

*Dear Uber*

We love how you disrupted the taxi industry, bruh, but trust, once broken, takes time to rebuild.
