### What's making us hopeful for 2018?

#### **Women rocking the boat**

Who would have thought that a year that started out with a philosophical debate about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_Girl" target="_blank">Fearless Girl</a> would end up as the year when women truly stood up against not just one but multiple powerful raging bulls? We went OMG when victims of sexual harassment and misconduct came forward to out some of the most powerful men in entertainment, media and politics, many of us went WTF when we read about how <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/csr/diversity/ethics/2017/12/22/ford-apple.html" target="_blank">male workers in Ford plants treated female co-workers</a> or how <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/23/business/media/vice-sexual-harassment.html?_r=0" target="_blank">male employees of Vice routinely harassed their female colleagues</a>. If 2017 gave birth to #MeToo, #BalanceTonPorc (English translation: Out Your Pig) and #WhatAboutUs, 2018 is starting out with <a href="https://www.timesupnow.com/" target="_blank">#TIMESUP</a>. We have every reason to believe that 2018 will bring about more empowerment for women and meaningful change in workplace culture. Things won't change overnight but it will start soon. Because women simply cannot afford to let this moment pass.

P.S. Women proved they can bring in the dinero in Hollywood with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/01/women-fronted-films-top-three-highest-grossing-2017" target="_blank">women-fronted films as the top three highest grossing films in 2017.

#### **From Paris with love**

Yes, President Trump wants the US to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but it seems that all the other countries may just call his bluff. For one, <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/12/08/mayor-agreement.html" target="_blank">US states and cities want to stick to the COP 21 commitments</a> in Paris, so his local government support is left wanting. France's decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/20/france-bans-fracking-and-oil-extraction-in-all-of-its-territories" target="_blank"> ban fracking and oil extraction in its territories</a> may be largely symbolic, but by doing so, President Emmanuel Macron effectively becomes the guardian of the moral compass on climate action. But the real action is happening in China, one of the world's top carbon emitters. China is kicking *ss in <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/07/18/technology/china-us-clean-energy-solar-farm/index.html" target="_blank">developing renewable energy</a> and is seriously <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/diversity/environment/2017/12/06/women-fines.html" target="_blank">cracking down on violations of its environmental regulations</a>. Things may be depressing at home, but the rest of the world is doing a lot of heavy lifting, and there lies hope.


#### **The fight for net neutrality is far from over**

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may have dinged us last year by repealing net neutrality, but the net community is fighting back. State attorneys are <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/12/14/net-neutrality-fcc-lawsuit-ajit-pai/" target="_blank">suing to compel the FCC</a> to cooperate with the New York State attorney's investigation on 2 million alleged fake public comments. Consumer groups have also vowed to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/19/the-net-neutrality-lawsuits-are-coming-heres-what-theyre-likely-to-say/?utm_term=.4d07603eb1d8" target="_blank">challenge the ruling in court</a>. The ruling <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/ethics/csr/privacy/2017/11/21/throttled.html" target="_blank">changed the internet</a> as we know it, but this is an issue many feel strongly about, and hopefully one that many are willing to fight for.

#### **Money is finally talkin'**

Investors are finally putting their collective foot down for companies to shape up on various issues from climate to political spending. In December, at least <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/ethics/environment/human%20rights/2017/12/13/net-neutrality.html" target="_blank">225 investors said</a> they would keep a close eye on companies that emit a lot of emissions and will publish an annual report on how these firms are cutting emissions. The World Bank Group will stop financing oil and gas exploration projects, while some pension funds are <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/11/17/pipeline.html" target="_blank">planning to divest from fossil fuel companies</a>. Similarly, <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/ethics/2017/11/29/fake-blogs.html" target="_blank">mutual funds have been quietly supporting increased transparency on</a> corporate political spending. We're pumped that investors are using their dollar power to push for better corporate behavior and expect more of these in 2018.

Happy new year!
