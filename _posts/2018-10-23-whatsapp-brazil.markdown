### WhatsApp bans 100,000 accounts in Brazil

WhatsApp announced it has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-19/whatsapp-bans-more-than-100-000-accounts-in-brazil-election" target="_blank">banned approximately 100,000 accounts in Brazil</a> following reports that the instant messaging service had become a major conduit for spam and fake news ahead of Brazil's hotly contested presidential elections. Sounds familiar?

#### Give me the deets

Brazilians are going to the polls for the first round of its rather complicated national elections on October 28. In the running are extreme right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro against leftist Workersâ€™ Party candidate Fernando Haddad. In the last few days, spam messages and fake news against Haddad have apparently <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/whatsapp-implicated-in-bitter-turn-to-brazil-election-1.3671006" target="_blank">proliferated via WhatsApp</a>, prompting the Brazilian police to open an investigation.

#### It's complicated

If you are a WhatsApp user, you know that messages are encrypted, which is great for privacy, but a nightmare for monitoring and weeding out spam. WhatsApp, now owned by Facebook, said it is deploying its high-tech arsenal to detect spam and identify accounts that are being used to spread misinformation. The company did ban the account of Bolsonaro's son.

#### Why is this important?

Because the tools that have become essential to daily modern life are also being used to undermine democracy and human rights. The tools that were meant to facilitate connections have become instruments of mistrust. Cue for nostalgia for life before the internet.

#### **Why is Uber raising fares in London?**

Because it wants to raise funds for a clean energy fund. The cost of an Uber ride in London will increase by 15 pence in order to raise $260 million for the fund that will help drivers switch to electric vehicles.
