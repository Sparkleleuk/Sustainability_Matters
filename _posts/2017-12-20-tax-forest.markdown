### Tax cut savings: Companies pay it forward, for now

The Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was approved by both chambers of Congress, with legislators voting for the bill strictly along party lines. Among the highlights of the new bill, which is almost certain to be signed into law by President Trump, is a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Companies such as AT&T, Wells Fargo, Fifth Third Bancorp, Boeing, and Comcast immediately [announced](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/wells-fargo-at-t-try-to-prove-unpopular-tax-cut-goes-to-workers?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social) that they are planning to use the corporate tax cuts to increase bonuses, salaries, and investments in employee training.

#### Why are they doing this?

Companies are obviously supportive of this tax bill because, who does not want a tax cut? So they want to show that the unpopular bill can also benefit workers and not just corporations. AT&T announced it would give $1,000 to each of its 200,000 employees, and the same goes for Comcast for its 100,000 staff. Wells Fargo said it would [raise its minimum wage](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/20/handful-companies-promise-bonuses-pay-raises/971199001/) to $15 per hour, an 11% increase from its current hourly rate of $13.50, once the law was passed. The pay raise will go into effect in March 2018.

#### Well and good, however...

AT&T and Comcast's combined bonuses will amount to a $300 million, which sounds puny relative to their financials. In the second quarter of 2017 alone, AT&T [reported](http://about.att.com/story/att_second_quarter_earnings_2017.html) revenues of $39.8 billion, operating income of $7.3 billion, cash from operations of $8.9 billion and free cash flow of $3.7 billion. All these figures essentially mean that AT&T does not need a tax cut to pay for $200 million in bonuses. It can finance this amount from one quarter's cash alone.

Wells Fargo's announcement that it will increase hourly wages after the law is passed seems odd because as early as September 2017, it had already [announced a wage increase](https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/commitment/progress-report.pdf) to atone for its controversial practice of creating fake customer accounts.

#### Our takes

We'll take the dough (it's Christmas after all), but we can't thank the tax bill for it.

### Earth lost a 10% of wilderness since 1992

A [study by the University of Queensland](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/21/losing-the-wilderness-a-tenth-has-gone-since-1992-and-gone-for-good) shows that 10% of the earth's wilderness equivalent to  3 million square kilometers or 1.16 square miles has been lost due to human pressure. The study found that 52% of the earth's ecosystems have been degraded while the remaining 48% is being eroded. The authors warned that we could lose all wildnerness in the next 50 years if the rate of degradation continues.

#### Why does this matter?

The degradation of pristine forests has huge environmental impacts, ranging from biodiversity to climate risk mitigation because these areas store carbon and help build defenses against extreme temperatures. Forests like the Amazon are not called the lungs of the earth for nothing. Human activities like logging and mining are putting severe pressure on these areas, leading to degradation and erosion.

#### What's happening in Europe?

Europe has been planting more trees to expand forest cover. But it appears to be planting the wrong type of trees. Conifers and pine trees may have stoked increased temperatures in the region because they trap the sun's heat and expend more carbon, according to a [study](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-forests/europes-shift-to-dark-green-forests-stokes-global-warming-study-idUSKCN0VD2KV). So much for planting more trees.
