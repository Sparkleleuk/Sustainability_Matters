### Proposal relaxes Obama-era rules but could lead to more deaths

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://www.axios.com/epa-obama-climate-policy-rule-carbon-f4204c22-996d-4eb2-9fcb-b227c23ae0b1.html" target="_blank">unveiled</a> on August 21 its "Affordable Clean Energy" proposal that reduces carbon dioxide limits on coal-fired power plants. The proposal would replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which was intended to cut nationwide emissions from power plants by 32% by 2030, relative to 2005 levels.

#### The deets

The Trump proposal will require coal-fired power plants to cut carbon emissions within its fence line only, and not across the company's fleet. The proposal also grants states more flexibility to set carbon emission limits, instead of a federally-imposed rule. Check out the rest of the proposal <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-08/documents/ace_overview_0.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### And the catch

But in its own <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/climate/epa-coal-pollution-deaths.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank">analysis</a>, the EPA said relaxing emissions rules would release more pollutants that could lead to up to 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 from heart and lung disease. And up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems. So, coal vs man, coal wins?

#### Why does this matter?

Because, climate change. Coal is, by far, the highest source of emissions among all energy sources. Relaxing rules can only increase overall emissions (although the EPA said the increase would be "slight"), not to mention exact a heavy toll on human life. The Trump administration may be throwing a lifeline to the coal industry, but the use of coal in the US has been on the <a href="https://www.axios.com/clean-power-plan-replacement-trump-administration-coal-067a75b4-8fb6-4352-858a-f514cbd62a38.html" target="_blank">decline</a> for the last 20 years. This is what we would call prolonging the agony.

**BEFORE YOU GO..**

#### **2018 heat smashed previous records**

It's been a brutal year Heat records were <a href="https://www.axios.com/heat-records-temperature-climate-change-map-f82a017b-4383-43d0-ae52-42517138b108.html" target="_blank">smashed</a> from Japan to Oman to Canada to Norway in 2018. Thirty years ago, NASA scientist James Hansen <a href="https://climatechange.procon.org/sourcefiles/1988_Hansen_Senate_Testimony.pdf" target="_blank">warned</a> the world about the arrival of global warming. ETA: Yesterday.
