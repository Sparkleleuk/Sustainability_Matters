### GM's layoffs would be good for EVs, bad for workers

General Motors has <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2018/11/25/general-motors-planning-oshawa-ontario-plant-closure/38606867/" target="_blank">announced</a> a major restructuring program that would entail the loss of more than 14,000 jobs. The company plans to idle at least five manufacturing plants.

#### The low down

GM has decided to cease production of sedans, and this will affect plants in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland and Ontario, Canada and affecting approximately 6,300 workers. These workers will be given the option to transfer to the company's "growth" plants. The company will also lay off approximately 6,000 salaried workers in 2019. GM started a buyout program for its employees in October but it reportedly had only 2,250 takers. GM is set to begin negotiations with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union on the fate of the plants and the workers affected by the layoffs.

#### Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions, Zero Congestion

The decision to layoff is part of GM's rebranding to focus on self-driving and electric cars. In fact, it has a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/business/gm-oshawa-plant/index.html" target="_blank">new motto</a> (see above). The company expects to save $6 billion by 2020, which it plans to use to develop more autonomous cars and electric vehicles. GM is also stopping production of sedans because apparently Americans want SUVs and trucks instead. And finally, the company has been hit by President Trump's trade war with China because auto companies need steel manufactured by Chinese companies.

#### Why is this important?

Because GM recognizes the potential for electric vehicles and is acknowledging that the auto industry wants to be part of the climate solution. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost to the livelihood of thousands of loyal GM workers. There's a lot at stake in the company's negotiations with the UAW. TBD if they are able to reach an agreeable solution.
