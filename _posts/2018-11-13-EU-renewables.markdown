### EU mandates renewable energy to make up 32% of energy consumed by 2030

The <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20181106IPR18315/energy-new-ambitious-targets-on-renewables-and-energy-efficiency" target="_blank">EU parliament voted</a> on November 13 in favor of a binding agreement that 32% of total energy consumed in the EU zone should be from renewable energy by 2030. Members of parliament also approved an "indicative target" of 32.5% energy efficiency by the same year.

#### What does this mean exactly?

This means that in 12 years, energy efficiency in the EU has to have improved by 32.5% while the share of renewable energy in the EU's gross final energy consumption must be at least 32%. Both targets will be revised by 2023 and can only be raised, not lowered. The parliament also required that at least 14% of fuel for transportation must come from renewable energy by 2030.

#### What's in it for the average European?

The EU expects a reduction in home energy bills over time, while Europe will reduce its reliance on external suppliers of oil and gas. Because, Russia. Member states are also required to make sure that their citizens are entitled to generate renewable energy for their own use and can sell excess production.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, climate change. Fossil fuels are the highest emitters of greenhouse gas and the most significant contributor to global warming. The EU's move is an effort to reduce emissions from the biggest source.

#### P.S. Over in Spain...

The Spanish government is preparing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-13/spain-to-outlaw-diesel-gasoline-car-sales-in-2040-under-new-law?cmpid=BBD111418_GBIZ&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=181114&utm_campaign=goodbiz" target="_blank">legislation</a> to support a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% from 1990 levels in 2030 and by 90% in 2050. It is looking to ban new oil exploration and prohibit fracking by 2040. It may ban the sale of diesel and gasoline cars starting 2040.

**IF YOU'RE PLANNING TO DRIVE ELECTRIC...**

#### **Tesla is not enough**

The International Energy Agency said in its annual World Energy Outlook that driving e-vehicles may even lead to increased use of power plants because well, e-vehicles need to be charged. Dang. The IEA is saying that electrication of transport needs to be part of a comprehensive carbon reduction plan.
