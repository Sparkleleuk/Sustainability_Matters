### Straws, other single-use plastics on their way out in the UK

The British government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-government-rallies-commonwealth-to-unite-on-marine-waste" target="_blank">announced plans</a> to ban the sale of single-use plastics such as straws, drink stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds to curb plastic pollution. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said in a press release: "Single-use plastics are a scourge on our seas and lethal to our precious environment and wildlife so it is vital we act now. We have already banned harmful microbeads and cut plastic bag use, and now we want to take action on straws, stirrers and cotton buds to help protect our marine life."

#### Private sector joins the party

More than 40 companies in the UK are supporting the broader effort against plastic waste by signing up to the <a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/the-uk-plastics-pact" target="_blank">UK Plastics Pact</a>. The signatories include companies such as Sainsbury's, Nestle and Coca-Cola, and are <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/plastic-ban-uk-business-pact-pledge-single-use-a8322156.html" target="_blank">collectively responsible</a> for more than 80% of the UK supermarket plastic packaging. The signatories to the Pact commit that by 2025,  100% of their plastic packaging would be reusable, recyclable or compostable, 70% of plastic packaging effectively recycled or compostable, to "take action" to eliminate single-use plastics, and to have 30% of the content of the plastic packaging would be recycled.

#### Why does this matter?

Because the United Nations has declared the abundance of plastics as <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42225915" target="_blank">a "planetary crisis"</a>. Plastics are clogging up the oceans and other waterways, causing severe negative impacts on marine life. China is by far, the world's largest producer of plastic waste, followed by Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Need more evidence about the harmful effects of plastic waste?

#### **Trusting the chain**

IBM has introduced TrustChain, a blockchain that is intended to trace the sourcing of jewelry, from the mine to the store. TrustChain allows for the validation of transaction at every step of the way, but without the paper work, and with less room to game the system. And why is this important? Because, you don't want to wear blood diamonds forever.
