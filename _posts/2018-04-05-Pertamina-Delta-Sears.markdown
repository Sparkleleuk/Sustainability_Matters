### Pertamina pipeline caused oil spill

Indonesia's national oil and gas company, Pertamina, today admitted that <a href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/04/04/burst-undersea-pipeline-caused-oil-spill-says-pertamina.html" target="_blank">a burst underwater pipeline</a> caused last weekend's oil spill off the coast of Borneo island. The pipeline, located 25 meters under the sea, is used to transport crude oil from Lawe-lawe Terminal in North Penajam Paser regency to the company's refinery in Balikpapan. Pertamina officials said the cause of the pipeline leak is being investigated.

#### Rewind, replay

Fire broke off Balikpapan Bay on March 31, <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2018/04/03/indonesia-spill.html" target="_blank">killing four fishermen</a> and causing the spill. Local residents reported difficulty in breathing, vomiting and nausea. Pertamina officials initially denied that the company was the cause of spill and said that there was no evidence of a leak in its pipeline. The government declared a state of emergency and said it was investigating a vessel operated by Chinese nationals.

#### Why does this matter?

An area of nearly 13,000 hectares is now covered by oil, nearly similar to the <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/finance/csr/environment/2018/01/17/Blackrock-China.html" target="_blank">East Asia oil spill</a> in January. Approximately 60 kilometers of coastal ecosystems have been contaminated, according to Indonesia's environment ministry. The government is, however, is likely to put the blame on a coal vessel that dropped anchor in Balikpapan Bay than on Pertmanina. The anchor apparently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-environment-oil/indonesia-blames-coal-ship-for-oil-spill-not-state-energy-firm-idUSKCN1HC1FP" target="_blank">dragged the pipeline</a> more than 100 meters and caused it to crack.

### Delta, Sears' online support service hacked

An online support service used by Delta Air Lines and retailer Sears was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-delta-air-cyber-24-7-ai/sears-holding-delta-air-hit-by-customer-data-breach-at-tech-firm-idUSKCN1HC089?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&utm_content=5ac5ab0004d3015b09b97dbd&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">hacked in 2017</a>, compromising payment data of possibly hundreds of thousands of customers. The breach occurred in [ 24]7.ai, a technology firm that provides online support services. The breach occurred on or after September 26, 2017 and resolved by October 12 and only appeared to have affected credit card information.

#### Why does this matter?

Because it took months for the service provider to notify Delta and Sears. Given the sensitive nature of data compromised, companies need to be transparent so that their customers can remediate negative impacts on their privacy. Lack of transparency just smacks of irresponsibility.

#### **Quote of the day: A mistake**

<em>It’s clear now that we didn’t do enough. We didn’t focus enough on preventing abuse and thinking through how people could use these tools to do harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, hate speech, in addition to developers and data privacy. We didn’t take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake. It was my mistake.</em> ~ Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, in one of a series of Q&As on data privacy and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/hard-questions-protecting-peoples-information/" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
