### New poll shows declining trust in US corporations, but people expect more from CEOs

An annual poll by a public relations firm shows that people's trust in US corporations continue to decline. The <a href="http://engageforgood.com/2018-edelman-trust-barometer-2/" target="_blank">2018 Edelman Trust Barometer</a> shows that trust in companies headquartered in the US dropped from 55% to 50% in 2017, after having dropped from 61% in 2014. Edelman polled 33,000 individuals across 28 countries, and the results were released today.

#### People want CEOs to be bolder

The Edelman poll showed that 64% of respondents agree that "CEOs should take the lead on (social) change rather than wait for government to impose it". The poll also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/business/dealbook/ceos-social-change.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">found</a> that “all age groups expect a company’s C.E.O. to be personally visible in sharing its purpose and vision”. This expectation was highest among 55 year olds and older, with 83%. At least 84% of respondents expect CEOs "to inform conversations and policy debates on one or more issues" and 56% said they "have no respect for CEOs who remain silent on important issues." Yet, even if they thought that CEOs should be bolder on social change, 71% of respondents are still more likely to believe what they hear from employees than from the head honchos. Trust issues run deep.   

#### Our take

This poll confirms that the days when a corporation's sole responsibility to make money for its shareholders (think: Milton Friedman). More people think that corporations are part of the social fabric and should be engines of social change. In the wake of the Parkland, Florida shooting, for example, Delta Airlines and eight other companies ended their discount programs for members of the National Rifle Association, while Bank of America and Citigroup said they are restricting financial services to certain types of gun makers. Dick Sporting Goods and Walmart also stopped selling military-style assault rifles and magazines. While some conservative groups are unhappy about these decisions, these companies are getting a lot of love on social media. Therefore, companies that take a bold stance on social issues are likely to earn public goodwill than companies that remain in the sidelines. Indeed, this is the age of engagement and civic action. Corporate apathy is so 1970s.

#### **The whales are making a comeback**

Female humpback whales in the southern oceans near Antarctica are experiencing higher pregnancy rates and giving birth to more calves. Scientists think that the whale population is now reaping the benefits of the ban on whaling imposed in the 1980s as well as, ironically, the warming temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/science/humpback-whale-antarctica.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fclimate&action=click&contentCollection=climate&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=7&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
