### Ronald McDonald has been naughty, apparently

A group of trade unions have accused fast food chain McDonald’s of avoiding taxes through accounting maneuvers that involve the use of known tax havens.

#### New corporate tax structure

The <a href="https://www.epsu.org/sites/default/files/article/files/Unhappier_Meal_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">“Unhappier Meal” report</a> prepared by US and European trade unions, noted that following an investigation by the European Commission, the company changed its corporate tax structure by moving its international base from domicile from Luxembourg to the UK, and using companies in known tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Guernsey. The unions said the new structure “effectively inhibits public scrutiny, as many of the new entities have no or minimal required public financial disclosures, including of taxes owed and paid.”

#### Taking advantage of Brexit?

The unions also pointed out the by moving its international headquarters to the UK, which is expected to exit the European Union, the company may be trying to “minimize any oversight by the European Commission”.  Indeed, the EC will not have any oversight over the UK when it formally leaves the EU, prompting the unions to express concern that the UK could also become a tax haven.

#### Why does this matter?

The EC has aggressively been clamping down on tax avoidance by multinational firms over the last 10 years, ensnaring companies like Starbucks and Apple. Tax avoidance is not illegal but it sure is unpopular because it deprives countries of much needed revenues to finance government expenditures. If a company makes money from the sale of goods and services from a country’s residents, the country should at least benefit from it, or one would think so.

### US Senate overturns repeal of net neutrality

The US Senate today <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/05/senate-votes-to-overturn-ajit-pais-net-neutrality-repeal/" target="_blank">voted</a> to reverse the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) repeal of net neutrality rules. The Senate approved the Congressional Review Act (CRA), resolution that overturns the December 2017 decision of the FCC against net neutrality.

#### What's net neutrality again?

Net neutrality rules prohibit internet service providers from favoring certain content providers over others. They were implemented to provide a level playing field in the world wide web. The FCC repealed net neutrality rules last year so that the federal government "can stop micromanaging the internet".

#### What does today's vote mean?

It's a victory yes, but the story does not end here. The CRA needs to go through a vote in the House of Representatives where it is expected to face a stronger pushback. The House is dominated by Republicans who generally oppose net neutrality rules and prefer to deregulate the industry. If the resolution passes Congress, it needs to be approved by President Trump, also another roadblock.

#### Our take

We're hopeful but it's too early to celebrate.

Roll out the red carpet for the highest paid CEOs of 2017. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-highest-paid-ceos/" target="_blank">Bloomberg’s Pay Index</a> showed that Snap Inc. (read: Snapchat) CEO Evan Spiegel made a whopping $504.5 million last year largely due to the company going public.
