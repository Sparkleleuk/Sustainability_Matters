### Minimum wage at Disney World to rise to $15

Walt Disney and labor unions in Florida reached <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/25/news/companies/walt-disney-world-minimum-wage/index.html"  target="_blank">an agreement</a> on August 24 for an increase the minimum wage by more than 30%, following nine months of negotiations and labor protests by Disney World park workers. Walt Disney agreed to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2021.

#### Flashback 2017

Disney World employees started demanding for an increase in wages last year. The unions asked for a 35% increase while Walt Disney offer 2.5%. Months of negotiations led to <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/orange-county-deputies-break-up-rally-of-hundreds-of-disney-workers-demanding-pay-increase/627219687" target="_target">protests</a> by park workers. Disney earlier agreed to raise wages for workers in Disneyland in California to $15 by 2019.

#### A new contract + a bonus

Disney agreed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/business/disney-world-minimum-wage-union.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">to raise the minimum wage</a> in Disney World incrementally until it hits $15 in 2019. The new contract covers 38,000 employees represented by six unions that negotiated the increase. The minimum wage in Florida is $8.25 an hour. While many Disney World workers get $10, this is not enough to live on. The company also agreed to pay the $1000 bonus it promised to workers following the corporate tax cuts announced last year. The agreement is subject to union vote in September, but union members are expected to say "hell yeah".

#### Why does this matter?

Minimum wages in the US are increasingly a sore topic because seriously, who can live decently on these wages? The federal minimum wage alone is $7.25 an hour and many states <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/29/news/economy/2018-minimum-wage-increases/index.html" target="_blank">still pay less than $10 per hour</a>. Among the 50 states, California has the highest minimum wage at around $13 while Seattle has the highest among cities at more than $15. In contrast, all Canadian provinces have mandated <a href="https://www.retailcouncil.org/quickfacts/minimum-wage-by-province" target="_blank">minimum wages of above $10</a>. Meanwhile, retail industry CEOs are getting paid more and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/justcapital/2017/10/10/what-is-just-when-it-comes-to-ceo-to-average-worker-pay/#5f01767371f1" target="_blank">CEO to worker pay gap</a> in retail is the highest among all industries. Something just doesn't add up.

**ICYMI**

#### **Beijing is enjoying the cleanest air in a decade**

Beijing last month registered one of the lowest pollution readings since 2008. July pollution levels averaged 44 micrograms of airborne particles per cubic meter, the seventh lowest since recordings began in 2008, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-19/xi-s-clean-energy-drive-paints-bluest-sky-over-beijing-in-decade?utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_medium=social&cmpid=socialflow-facebook-business&utm_source=facebook" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a>. China has been ramping up the enforcement of environmental regulations and it looks like its paying dividends.
