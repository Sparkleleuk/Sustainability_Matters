### Indonesian oil spill threatens human health, marine life

The Indonesian government has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43625611" target="_blank">declared a state of emergency</a> following a massive oil spill off the coast of Borneo island over the weekend. The cause of the spill is still unknown but at least four fishermen were killed when fire broke out in the bay of Balikpapan. The spill covers an estimated 12 square kilometers (7 square miles).

#### Who is responsible?

TBD. Fisherman are <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/oil-spill-indonesia-2555846407.html" target="_blank">accusing the state oil company, Pertamina,</a> of having caused the spill, but Pertamina says it's not to blame. Pertamina operates an underwater pipeline and a crude oil refinery in Balikpapan and officials said there was no leak from its pipeline. Indonesian police are also reportedly questioning the crew of a bulk coal carrier operated by Chinese nationals.

#### Why does this matter?

The oil spill is threatening marine life in an area where fishing continues to be a major source of livelihood. Fishermen claimed that the spill has killed one dugong, a protected marine animal. Fumes from the fire has also caused respiratory problems in the nearby communities, including difficulty in breathing, nausea and vomiting.
