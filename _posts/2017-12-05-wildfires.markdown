### Wildfire hits southern California

A fast-moving wildfire swept through Ventura county in southern California today, destroying homes and property, and prompting the evacuation of approximately 27,000 people. Approximately 50,000 acres of land have been burned and at least 150 structures have been damaged, the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-school-fire-20171204-story.html) reported. California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Ventura, which mandates the release of additional funds and government personnel for the affected area.

#### Why does this matter?

To those living in the Ventura County area, why this event matters is a no brainer. For those living in  southern California, wildfires impact air quality and because the fire had not been contained yet as of the writing of this post, the fire still poses a risk to neighboring areas. For the rest of us, we should be concerned not just by the number of fires reported but also by the scale of the damage caused by these fires.  According to the [National Interagency Fire Center](https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/nfn.htm), there were 56,185 fires reported in 2017, burning a total of 9,185,901 acres of land. The Center's records show that in the last 10 years, the number of fires has actually declined from a high of 80,281 in 2007 to 56,185 as of November 30, 2017. But what is more concerning is an increase in the acreage affected. The 56,185 fires reported this year burned 9,185,901 acres of land, while the more than 80,000 fires recorded in 2007 damaged 8,900,885 acres. In 2015, a total of 56,130 fires burned 9,798,715 acres. These figures indicate that recent fires have become more intense and difficult to control, causing more damage to life and property.

#### What's driving the intensity?

While wildfires are caused by many factors including human activity (like not putting out campfires, or literally setting trees on fire), [studies](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heres-what-we-know-about-wildfires-and-climate-change/) show that forests in the western United States have also become drier due to warming temperatures. Drier forests and vegetation are, thus, more likely to burn.
