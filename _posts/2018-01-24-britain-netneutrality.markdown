### Britain aggressively goes after fake news

British Prime Minister Theresa May has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-fakenews/britain-to-set-up-unit-to-tackle-fake-news-mays-spokesman-idUSKBN1FC2AL" target="_blank">announced</a> that Britain will form a unit to counter fake news and deter disinformation campaigns by other states. The British government will use "national security communications" by creating a dedicated national security communications unit that will be tasked to combat disinformation by state actors and other players.

#### What does this mean?

This means that Britain is taking fake news seriously, more seriously than some countries like the US. Downing Street had earlier accused Russia of interfering in the British elections and Brexit referendum by planting fake news stories and images in social media platforms. Russia has denied the allegations. Meanwhile, US social media companies such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter has faced criticism not just in the United Kingdom but also in parts of Europe and the US for their failure to police their platforms. But last week, Facebook said it would <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/csr/privacy/human%20rights/2018/01/19/facebook.html" target="_blank">start ranking news sources</a> based on user opinion (dodgy until proven otherwise) and Twitter announced that it has uncovered more than 670,000 users in the US exposed to Russian-led disinformation campaigns  

#### Our take

It is clear that the proliferation of fake news has undermined democratic institutions and for this, we should be worried. The British government's move is reasonable given the threat it faces. But what to do if fake news is propagated by governments and the leaders themselves? What to do if fake news comes out of the horse's mouth itself?

### New York state, Burger King, AT&T join net neutrality fray

So three entities decided to make their mark on the net neutrality debate.

New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo today <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16928494/new-york-governor-net-neutrality-cuomo-executive-order" target="_blank">signed an executive order</a> requiring internet service providers to respect net neutrality rules if they want to keep their state contracts. According to the order, any service provider receiving or renewing a contract after March 1st in New York will be required to sign an agreement adhering to net neutrality principles.

Then, AT&T took out full-page ads in today's papers <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/24/technology/business/att-net-neutrality/index.html" target="_blank">calling on Congress</a> to pass a federal net neutrality law. Claiming that the company has faced "regulatory backlash", AT&T Randall Stephenson said the company wants Congress to establish an "Internet Bill of Rights" that guarantees net neutrality, an open internet, and privacy protection.

And then, fast food chain Burger King released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltzy5vRmN8Q" target="_blank">video</a> in support of net neutrality.

#### Making sense of the chaos

It was only a matter of time before Governor Cuomo would do a <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/csr/privacy/human%20rights/finance/2018/01/22/lloyds-montana.html" target="_blank">Montana</a> and sign a similar executive order. Now that the floodgates have been opened, we can expect other state governors supporting net neutrality to follow suit. There could be legal hurdles in implementing these orders though. The FCC, when it repealed net neutrality in December 2017, said states cannot create net neutrality rules, which means that these executive orders cannot override the repeal. So expect lawsuits flying around state capitals in the next few months. Nonetheless, the executive orders from Montana and New York put internet companies on notice.

And speaking of internet providers, AT&T's demand for a federal net neutrality law may seem odd, because it actually benefits from the repeal of net neutrality. But the barrage of state-level executive orders and other possible local actions are raining on the parade of broadband companies. They have to work with state governments to do business, but state governments are antagonistic, and are determined to put up roadblocks. The call for federal intervention means that AT&T would rather keep net neutrality and forego all the benefits of the repeal in exchange for regulatory stability.

What to make of Burger King's video? It's informative and entertaining, and gives a new twist to the whopper.

#### Our take

All these developments benefit us. Fierce opposition to the repeal means internet providers cannot easily impose restrictions on the internet, or risk the wrath of customer scorned. The longer the debate drags on, the better it is for the consumer.
