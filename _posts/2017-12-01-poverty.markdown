### Extreme poverty in the world's richest country

The UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights today began a [15-day](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22465&LangID=E) tour of the United States "to examine government efforts to eradicate poverty in the country, and how they relate to US obligations under international human rights law." Special Rapporteur Philip Alston said that the US experiences "great" poverty and inequality, and he would like to focus on how poverty affects people's civil and political rights. Alston is scheduled to visit the District of Columbia, California, Puerto Rico, and West Virginia. He is scheduled to announce his preliminary findings on December 15.

#### Alanis was right

It is ironic. With an official [poverty rate of 12%](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/income-povery.html), the US has one of the highest poverty rates among the [OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/poverty-rate.htm) (read: rich countries). It has an inequality rate of [nearly 40%](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/income-inequality.htm#indicator-chart), again making it one of the highest in the OECD. Only Costa Rica, Israel, Turkey, and Mexico were higher. And yet has the highest nominal GDP, has the largest and most profitable corporations, and has the most number of billionaires in the planet. Don't you wonder, where is the money going?

#### Why should we care?

Poverty and inequality lead to serious social ills and polarizes nations. Poverty leads to crime and lawlessness, which breeds more poverty. It's a vicious cycle.

#### P.S. WTH is Alanis???
