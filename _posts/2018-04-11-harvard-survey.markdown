### Millennials are mistrustful

Young Americans aged 18 to 29 mistrust big technology, Wall Street and media, along with President Trump, Congress and the federal government. A survey by the <a href="http://iop.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/content/Spring%202018%20Toplines%20%20-%20Web.pdf" target="_blank">Harvard Institute of Politics</a> conducted on March 8 to 25, 2018, showed that most of the respondents either never trust or only trust big technology companies sometimes. These companies are Amazon, Google, Uber, Facebook and Twitter. The respondents trust Uber, Facebook and Twitter the least, with around 70% of the respondents saying they never trust or trust these companies sometimes.

#### Will they do the right thing?

Millennials are also mistrustful of Wall Street and media. Approximately 85% said they never trust or only trust Wall Street sometimes, while 80% said the same for media. They don't trust President Trump either. Only 22% of the respondent said they trust him to do the right thing all or most of the time. The rest don't. Most millennials also disapprove of his handling of climate change, race relations, healthcare, and gun violence among other issues.

#### Why does this matter?

Because millennials represent the next wave of voters and consumers, and their views could alter the course of business and politics. From the lens of this survey, the way big tech, Wall Street and media engage with the public is unsustainable because millennials are not giving them a lot of love. It's time for a cool change.

<em>â€œMr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night? </em> Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) asked Mark Zuckerberg during the first day of Zuck's apology tour in Washington DC. Zuck replied no. We watched the hearing live on Facebook.
