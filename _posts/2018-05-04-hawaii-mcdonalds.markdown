### Hawaii poised to screen out sunscreens with harmful substances

Hawaii's congress has passed a bill that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/travel/hawaii-sunscreen-ban.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fclimate&action=click&contentCollection=climate&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=3&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">bans the sale of sunscreens</a> that contain substances that harm coral reefs and marine life. The bill is awaiting the approval of the state's governor. If signed, Hawaii becomes the first US state to effectively ban many mass market sunscreens, but the law would only take effect on January 1, 2021.

#### The substance in question is...

Oxybenzone (benzophenone-3), which, according to a <a href="http://www.haereticus-lab.org/sunscreen-chemical-threatens-coral-reefs/" target="_blank">2015 study</a>, damages coral reefs by inducing coral bleaching, destroying coral reef DNA and causing coral deformity, among others. The study found that the islands of Oahu and Maui have high concentrations of oxybenzone. Oxybenzone is found in approximately 3,500 sunscreen products, including common brands like Coppertone, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic, and Neutrogena. In addition to oxybenzone, sunscreens and personal care products may also include other <a href="http://www.haereticus-lab.org/protect-land-sea-certification/#link-target1/" target="_blank">pollutants</a>. The manufacturers of affected sunscreen brands are, predictably, unhappy with the bill. Bayer, the maker of Coppertone, said there are limited alternatives to oxybenzone and that there is limited peer-reviewed evidence that the substance causes coral bleaching.

#### Why does this matter?

Because Hawaii needs to protect its coral reefs. Hawaii receives at least eight million tourists a year, and the majority swim in the state's popular beaches. This means a lot of oxybenzone and other pollutants are left behind.

### McDonald's shareholders want to talk about straws

Shareholders McDonald's are pushing the fast food chain to ban drinking straws in the US, just as it committed to do so in the UK. Shareholders have filed a <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/30/mcdonalds-pushed-to-ban-plastic-straws-in-the-united-states-2/" target="_blank">resolution</a> that is up for a vote in the company's annual shareholders' meeting on May 24. The resolution calls for the company to study the business risks associated with the use of plastic straws, and to explore options for developing and implementing more environmentally-friendly substitutes. Note that this is typical shareholder resolution but what this essentially means is shareholders want the company to get rid of straws.

#### What is Ronald's position?

McDonald's management is urging shareholders to reject the proposal, saying that the requested report is "unnecessary" and "redundant to our current practices and initiatives, and has the potential for a diversion of resources with no corresponding benefit to the company, our customers, and our shareholders, particularly in light of our ongoing packaging sustainability efforts.‚Äù McDonald's has committed to use packaging from renewable, recycled or certified sources by 2025.

#### Why does this matter?

Because single-use plastics, such as straws, are contributing to high levels of water pollution. The UK is already looking to ban the use of single-use plastics, and private companies, such as McDonald's, have committed to withdraw them. A McDonald's customer in the UK would no longer get a drinking straw with his/her beverage unless specifically requested. McDonald's is also planning to pilot the use of paper straws there.

#### Our take

Removing plastic straws is not going to kill anybody. Nobody healthy enough to go to a fastfood restaurant really needs to use one anyway. McDonald's just has to do it.
