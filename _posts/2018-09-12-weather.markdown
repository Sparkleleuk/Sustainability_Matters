### US, Asia bracing for strong storms at the same time

From the Atlantic to the Pacific, people are tuned in to their weather channels as powerful storms prepare to make landfall at the same time this week.

#### The hurricanes

The southeastern coast of the continental US is bracing for Hurricane Florence, expected to make landfall in South Carolina in the next 24 to 48 hours. Florence is classified as a Category 3 hurricane and is likely to cause <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT1+shtml/122354.shtml" target="_blank">life-threatening storm surge</a> and bring in a lot of rain to South and North Carolina. Florence will affect more than 25 million people. Residents of coastal towns have been urged to evacuate.

Meanwhile, the former Hurricane Oliva was downgraded into a Tropical Storm category, and is approaching Oahu, the main island of Hawaii. The storm is expected to make landfall in the next 24 hours.

#### The typhoon

A "monster" typhoon is <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/philippines-10-million-people-path-mangkhut-180912120933417.html" target="_blank">approaching</a> the northern Philippines in the Pacific also in the next 48 hours. Packing winds of up to 205 kilometers per hour and gusts of up to 255 kilometers per hour, Typhoon Mangkut is expected to make landfall in the northern part of Luzon island, endangering more than 10 million people. The typhoon could also hit Hong Kong and Taiwan.

#### Are there other storms lurking?

Yep. The National Hurricane Center has <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/cyclones/" target="_blank"> monitored</a> one more hurricane, Hurricane Helene, and two storms, Joyce and Isaac brewing in the Atlantic. The storms appear to be heading to the eastern US and the Gulf of Mexico.

#### Why do these matter?

That storms are coming after a long hot summer in the northern hemisphere is not a surprise. Scientific studies have <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that warming sea surface temperatures contribute to the formation of more frequent and stronger storms and storm surges. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-surface-temperature" target="_blank">Research by the US Environmental Protection Agency</a> show that from 1901 through 2015, temperature rose at an average rate of 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Warm sea surface temperatures are side effects of global warming.

### FDA warns e-cig makers, retailers on teenage smoking

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is getting all tough on makers and retailers of e-cigarettes over teenage smoking. The FDA chief said smoking by teenagers below 18 years old has reached "an epidemic proportion".

#### The makers

The FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm620184.htm" target="_blank">warned</a> five major manufacturers, such as market leader JUUL Labs whose flavored e-cigarettes are popular among teenagers, to prove within 60 days that they can keep their products away from minors. Warnings were also sent to the manufacturers of these brands: Vuse, Blu, MarkTen XL, and Logic.

If they fail to do so, the FDA could order the removal of their products from the market. Companies also face the risk of civil or criminal charges if they are allowing bulk online sales. JUUL Labs said it is cooperating with the FDA and that it is "committed to preventing underage use of our product.‚Äù

#### The retailers

The FDA has also sent 1,300 <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/TobaccoProducts/NewsEvents/UCM620215.pdf" target="_blank">warning letters</a> to retailers ranging to stop selling e-cigarettes to minors. The retailers were given 15 days to respond. The FDA also issued 131 fines to retailers caught doing so, with the fines ranging from $279 to $11,182.

#### Why does this matter?

The agency noted that teenagers are particularly vulnerable to addiction, and e-cigarettes help increase nicotine addiction. Smoking remains a public health problem in the US and the alarm raised by the FDA reflects that the problem has worsened. A <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/teens-cigarettes-show-evidence-toxic-chemicals-smokers-study/story?id=53537714" target="_blank">study</a> released in the spring noted that vaping could lead to the presence of "concerning levels" of toxic chemicals.
