### Bitcoin mining uses too much of Iceland's energy

Bitcoin mining is using up too much of Iceland's renewable energy that the country is facing the prospect of running out of power. The Icelandic energy producer, HS Orka, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43030677" target="_blank">has noted</a> an "exponential" increase in energy demand in Iceland in the last six months, fueled by the establishment of data centers by companies mining bitcoins. So much so that it threatens the country's energy generation capability. Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, a business development manager at the energy company Hitaveita Sudurnesja, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/gold-rush-energy-demands-soar-iceland-bitcoins-52997828" target="_blank">said</a> he expected Iceland's virtual currency mining to double its energy consumption to about 100 megawatts this year, which is higher than Iceland's domestic consumption.

#### Ah bitcoins, LMGTFY

Created in 2009, bitcoins are virtual currencies that can be used anonymously, and traded without the use of banks or other middlemen. Bitcoins are created through "mining", which involves complex mathematical algorithms that, in turn, require high computing power. Keeping track and verifying transactions add to to the need for computing power. Companies engaged in bitcoin mining have been on the prowl for areas with cheaper power prices. Thus, Iceland, which generates 80% of its power from renewable sources and has the kind of temperatures that prevent servers from overheating, suddenly became a bitcoin mining hub. A lot of people have become uber rich from trading bitcoins after its value exploded to as much as $20,000 in 2017. And we're not just talking about <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/24/580259163/50-cent-i-forgot-taking-700-bitcoins-for-2014-album-stake-is-now-worth-millions" target="_blank">50 Cent's pleasant surprise</a>, but <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/05/winklevoss-twins-head-the-list-of-people-getting-very-rich-from-bitcoin.html" target="_blank">Winkelvoss twins dough</a>. This prompted governments like China and South Korea to invoke the R word (read: regulation), sending the price crashing back to earth in early 2018.

#### Why does this matter?

Because this shows that bitcoins are not as sustainable as we've been made to believe. Sure, bitcoins don't use paper or minerals like copper or silver, but producing and maintaining them requires a lot of energy. And high energy demand can be perilous at this age of climate change. Moreover, the rise of bitcoins over the last year has been fueled by speculation, which as we all know, is not the most sustainable way of growing wealth. An Icelandic member of parliament is proposing additional taxes on bitcoin mining companies setting up data centers in Iceland. Making them pay for the additional strain on resources is not just fair but also helps the country prepare for the unwanted possibility of having to import energy sources.

#### Our take

We believe cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and we're fine if they become part of regular commerce. But as the clich√© goes, not everything that glitters is gold. Bitcoins have hidden costs and dangers, ranging from energy use to the lack of oversight. BCOT.
