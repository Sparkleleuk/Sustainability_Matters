### Saudi Arabia says yes to women soldiers

The Saudi government is <a href="https://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/gulf/2018/02/22/Saudi-Arabia-opens-soldier-rank-positions-for-women-in-7-regions.html" target="_blank">allowing local women to join the military</a> as long as they are of Saudi origin, were brought up in the country, and for married women, should have a spouse who is a Saudi national. Women can apply for soldier rank positions in different regions of the country, including the capital Riyadh, Mecca, al-Qusaim, and al-Madina. On February 26, the government <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/02/27/saudi-arabia-allows-women-to-join-military-promotes-female-to-high-level-post.html" target="_blank">appointed a woman</a>, Tamadur bint Youssef al-Ramah, as deputy labor minister, the highest ministerial post occupied by a woman.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, gender equality. Opening up the military to women is a radical step by the Saudi Arabian government under the 32-year-old Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. We think it demonstrates its commitment to ease the historically severe restrictions on its women. These restrictions have gradually been eased in the last few years, with women finally being allowed to drive starting June 2018, as well as watch soccer matches. While all these activities are taken for granted elsewhere, it is a big deal in the conservative kingdom.

#### Our take

Props to the Saudi prince for all these reforms. Acceptance of these new "freedoms" in the Saudi society will not happen overnight, and we think that Saudi women will face many challenges before they are seen by men as equals. But the #MeToo movement shows that gender equality has a long way to go everywhere anyway, so cheers to the small wins.

A <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaaad3/pdf" target="_blank">new study</a> predicting that European cities face a much warmer future and face more flood risks. Not the most uplifting report but something to help us keep our eyes on the biggest picture.
