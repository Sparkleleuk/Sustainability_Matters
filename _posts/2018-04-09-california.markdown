### California will still be as dry as ever

The Sierra Nevadas experienced heavy snowfall in March but experts say the snowpack is just half the historical average in the area. In the <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/California-s-snowpack-is-heftier-than-it-was-a-12799477.php" target="_blank">latest snow survey</a>, surveyors found 32.1 inches of snow with 12.4 inches of water content, which is just 49% of the long-term average in the Sierra region since 1941.

#### Why does this matter?

Because water content in snow helps experts determine water supply in California for the year. Since 2011, California has experienced severe dry periods, with widespread negative impacts from lower crop production and wildfires to state-imposed water use restrictions and high water bills. And because California is the country's largest agricultural producer, California's water woes is the national concern. Unfortunately, fluffy snow that we all love don't really contain a lot of water and while California had a lot of it this year, it didn't do much to change the state's water supply outlook.

#### The silver lining

The Sierras packed enough snow this year, enough for California to get by in 2018, according to experts. A small consolation for a state whose long-term prospects continues to be bleak.
