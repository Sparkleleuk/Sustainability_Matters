**HEALTHCARE**

### CVS and Aetna's marriage of convenience

Over the weekend, US pharmacy chain CVS bought insurance provider Aetna to create a one-stop healthcare shop for customers. The $69 billion [acquisition](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/12/03/cvs-buying-aetna-deal-valued-69-billion-reports/917685001/) is said to be a preemptive move to counter Amazon's foray into the healthcare business. The deal is still subject to anti-trust clearance.

#### What's in it for us?

If the deal clears regulatory hurdles, the short-term impact is convenience. Getting insurance could become as easy as going to one of CVS' approximately 9,700 stores and processing of insurance claims could become less onerous. CVS also plans to expand its health services, which means an expansion of healthcare access through a CVS store or one of its 1,100 walk-in clinics.

#### Will this merger bring down drug prices?

Some think there could be discounts as CVS and Aetna are large enough to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. But pricing is ultimately a decision by the pharma industry and unless this industry budges, drug prices will remain the same. CVS and Aetna also hope they can reduce long-term health care costs by reducing the chances of emergency room visits by monitoring and patient data tracking. We hope so too.

### Protected no more: Trump cuts size of two national monuments

President Trump today signed two presidential proclamations [reducing](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/04/politics/utah-monuments-trump-weir/index.html) the size of two national monuments in Utah. The Trump administration reduced the size of the Bears Ears National Monument by more than 80% from 1.35 million acres to 228,337 acres, and reduced the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument by 45% from 1.9 million acres to 1 million acres. Thousands of people in Salt Lake City  [protested](http://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/12/04/thousands-of-protesters-in-utah-decry-hatch-trump-and-the-revision-of-national-monuments/) the proclamations. Five Native American tribes have announced [plans to sue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-scales-back-two-huge-national-monuments-in-utah-drawing-praise-and-protests/2017/12/04/758c85c6-d908-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html?utm_term=.e4c3a66ba664) the government for these actions.

#### Why does this matter?

Both monuments are home to archeological treasures, some of which date back to the dinosaur era. The sites are also important to Native American tribes who still visit the sites for their rituals. Supporters, including cattle ranchers believe that the proclamations "free up" these lands to economic activity. Critics believe that the area has been opened up not just to cattle ranchers but to oil and mining companies because both areas are believed to be rich in mineral deposits.

#### Our take

The Trump administration just [granted](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/eni-receives-federal-permit-us-arctic-offshore-drilling-51442959) an Italian oil company a federal permit to drill in the Arctic. The Republican-led US Congress is about to open up the Alaska National Wildlife refuge to oil exploration. We say it's time to visit southern Utah before bulldozers and heavy equipment take over.
