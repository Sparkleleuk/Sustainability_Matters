### Wynn Resorts CEO has been naughty, apparently

Dozens of women have accused Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn of sexual misconduct. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <a href="https://www.axios.com/several-people-accuse-billionaire-casino-mogul-steve-wynn-of-sexual-misconduct-d7c1aabd-eb2c-4377-8a4f-f7c832502d7e.html?source=sidebar" target="_blank">reported</a> a "decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct" including forcing employees to perform sex acts. Women interviewed by the Wall Street Journal said they did not report the misconduct for fear of losing their jobs or not finding new ones given Wynn's influence in the casino and hospitality industry. Wynn, who also serves as the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, has <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/26/investing/steve-wynn-sexual-misconduct/index.html" target="_blank">denied the allegations</a>, saying, "The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous". In a statement to the WSJ the company said, â€œSince the inception of the company, not one complaint was made to that (anonymous employee) hotline regarding Mr. Wynn."

#### Why does this matter?

This matters because Wynn Resorts' share price <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&q=NASDAQ:+WYNN&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNzKuyKyryeAC2beXwOgAAAA&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj2vueo5_bYAhUDTt8KHQzqBMIQ6c8CCDEwAA&biw=1227&bih=561#scso=uid_GL1rWv6ABeKyggf24pzgBg_5:0" blank="_target">plunged by 10%</a> on the news. So investors didn't think the allegations were preposterous. Wynn Resorts is the first publicly-listed company that saw an immediate investor sell-off as a result of sexual misconduct allegations against its CEO, demonstrating that these types of allegations are now financially material. Wynn is now facing <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-steve-wynn-20180126-story.html" target="_blank">calls for an investigation</a> or even his resignation. Wynn said he is not stepping down either as CEO or as finance chairman of the RNC.

#### Our take

As founder of the casino chain, Wynn has an outsized influence in Wynn Resorts, thus, allegations of misconduct can be destabilizing to the company. CEO misconduct, whether sexual or otherwise, is a reflection of company culture. Therefore, these allegations not only expose Wynn the person, but the company itself, and may ultimately reveal a culture that tolerates the abuse of power and the exploitation of vulnerable workers.
