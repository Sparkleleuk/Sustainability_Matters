### China wants to beat smog by cutting coal and steel production

China's state planning body today said it will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-steel-coal/china-to-cut-more-coal-steel-output-to-defend-blue-skies-idUSKBN1GH034" target="_blank">reduce coal output and steep production in 2018</a> to reduce pollution. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) stated in a report that it will reduce coal output by approximately 150 million tons (or 3.47% of 2017 output of 3.45 billion tons) and steel by 30 million tons (or 3.8% of 2017 output of 832 million tons).

#### Give me the context

China is the world's top coal and steel producer and it is no coincidence that it is also the top emitter of carbon dioxide. You know, that thing that captures and traps heat, and causes global warming. One of Beijing's strategies to meet its environmental commitments made in COP 21 is to reduce reliance on heavy industries and shift to cleaner energy sources. China's plan is to cut its coal capacity by 500 million tons and its steel capacity by 150 million by 2020.

#### And the 2018 cuts...

Help Beijing meet its 2020 targets ahead of schedule. By cutting coal capacity to 150 million in 2018, total cuts would amount to 590 million by end of 2018. It only needs to reduce another 90 million to meet its target. The same holds true for steel. By the end of this year, total cuts to steep production would be 145 million, or 5 million below the target for 2020. Note, however, that China's coal production in 2017 rose by 3.2% and steel production hit a record high. So, a reduction is probably necessary.  

#### Why does this matter?

Because, climate change. China has, in all fairness, tried to reduce its own carbon footprint, and is even willing to <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/12/26/china-growth.html" target="_blank">sacrifice a bit of economic growth</a> to get rid of the smog. It has aggressively pursued climate-friendly policies and actively <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/diversity/environment/2017/12/06/women-fines.html" target="_blank">enforced environmental laws</a>. China has a lot of environmental problems to solve but props to Beijing for making the effort.

**BEFORE YOU GO...**

#### **Quotes of the day: The survey**

"In thinking about an ideal world where you could set Facebook's policies, how would you handle the following: a private message in which an adult man asks a 14 year old girl for sexual pictures." A question in Facebook's survey on March 4, 2018.

â€œThis is a stupid and irresponsible survey. Adult men asking 14-year-olds to send sexual images is not only against the law, it is completely wrong and an appalling abuse and exploitation of children." Yvette Cooper, Member of UK Parliament and chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee.

Hmmm, what was FB thinking? Read it all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/05/facebook-men-children-sexual-images" target="_blank">here</a>.
