### California plans its electricity grid to be 100% carbon-free by 2045

California's state legislators <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/business/energy-environment/california-clean-energy.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=13&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">voted</a> on August 28 for a bill mandating that 100% of the state's electricity come from renewable energy in 27 years. California's State Assembly also voted to increase the use of renewable energy from 50% to 60% by 2030. Legislators voted 44-33 in favor of the bill.

#### Who supported?

The bill was put forward by Democratic State Senator Kevin de Le√≥n who is running against a fellow Dem, Senator Dianne Feinstein, in the November mid-term elections. Former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and former Vice President Al Gore, a Democrat, also gave the thumbs up. Supporters say the push for more renewable energy will not only be climate-friendly, it will create jobs and boost the state economy.

#### Who's skeptical?

Investor-owned utilities are unhappy, saying that the bill focused on their sector while transportation remains the highest source of emissions in the state. Critics warn that this will mean higher electricity costs for consumers. Utilities are also concerned that wind and solar power are still unpredictable and utilities may not be able to meet electricity needs without fossil fuels.

#### Why does this matter?

When the bill passes into law, California will become the second US state to aim for 100% carbon-free electricity grid, following Hawaii. Sure, electricity is just one source of emissions, but California's air pollution standards for motor vehicles are stricter than the federal government's. This means that the state does deal with major sources of emissions.

**EARLY WARNING**

#### **Tech giants face increased regulatory risk**

President Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/google-under-fire-again-on-search-as-hatch-calls-for-ftc-probe" target="_blank">hinted</a> that Amazon, Facebook and Google, may face antitrust risks, although he declined to comment further on whether these companies needed to be broken up. Republican Senator Orrin Hatch also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-antitrust-google/republican-senator-asks-ftc-to-examine-google-ads-idUSKCN1LF275" target="_blank">asked</a> the Federal Trade Commission to reopen an antitrust investigation against Google. Trump recently accused Google of manipulating search results in favor of "fake media". Big tech is now treading dangerous waters.
