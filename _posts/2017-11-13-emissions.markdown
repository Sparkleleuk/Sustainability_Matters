### Carbon emissions on the rise again

A new report released today revealed that burning of fossil fuels is likely to hit a new high this year. The [Global Carbon Project](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/global-carbon-emissions-are-rising-again-after-3-flat-years/) estimates that by the end of 2017, approximately 37 billion tons of carbon dioxide will be emitted from burning fossil fuels, primarily caused by an expected 3.5% increase in China’s emissions.

#### Why does this matter?

37 billion tons of carbon emissions is the highest ever and occurs just three years before 2020, the year when, scientists say, emissions need to peak and then decelerate rapidly to temper the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C above the pre-industrial levels, by 2100. As we mentioned in a previous post, we are already starting to feel the impacts of higher temperatures and extreme weather patterns. The more extreme the weather, the more it costs us money, such as higher insurance premiums, more expensive goods, higher utility rates, and increased risk to human health.

#### The last word

We don’t have to wait for 2100 to feel the pain of a much warmer earth.

**LABOR**

### Is Tesla racist?

An Africa-American employee of Tesla, the electric car maker, has accused the company of [tolerating racist behavior](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-13/tesla-a-hotbed-for-racist-behavior-black-workers-claim-in-suit) in its production facilities. The employee is filing a proposed class action lawsuit on behalf of approximately 100 African-American employees who have been subjected to harassment in the production floor.

#### So what?

Who doesn't want to work for Tesla? Tesla is one of the sexiest companies to work for because of its ground-breaking work on electric cars. But employee issues tarnish the company's reputation and begs the question, is Tesla really sustainable? Earlier this year, another Tesla factory worker also filed a lawsuit alleging racial discrimination, while a female employee sued for harassment in 2016. Also last year, the company was accused of using labor from other states for its Reno, Nevada site, prompting [employees to walk out](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-29/about-100-workers-walk-out-at-tesla-battery-plant-building-site) of their jobs in protest.

#### Our take

Relative to the company's size, these complaints will not impact the company as much. But if accusations become more pervasive, they may end up compromising Tesla's long-term ability to retain and attract talent, which is important for the company to continue to innovate and produce high quality cars.
