**DIVERSITY**

### It's raining women

Well, not yet. But recent reports indicate that more women are running for public office in the US, and women are finally getting more seats in corporate boards.

#### Let’s start with politics

Emily’s List, a non-profit that supports women in public office, noted that the number of women who have contacted the group to run for office or get involved in politics jumped from 1,000 before the November 2016 elections to a whopping 22,000 over the last year, reported the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/women-candidates-office.html?_r=0 ). The Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University said the number of female candidates for House congressional positions is now four times the number in 2015. The number of female candidates in the Senate has doubled from 2015 and is 10 times higher than in the 2012 and 2014 elections.

#### Then the boardrooms

A survey by executive recruitment firm Spencer Stuart showed that more than 50% of new seats in corporate boardrooms went to women and ethnic minorities. Of 397 independent director slots open in the 2017 proxy season, 36% went to women and 20% to minorities, according to the survey results reported by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/women-minorities-capture-most-new-board-seats-for-first-time). Women and minorities combined made up 50.1% of the new board members, compared with 42% last year, the data showed.

#### Then the push from Wall Street

The largest investment managers are finally supporting for shareholder resolutions that call for more women in corporate boards. Between the two largest money managers, Blackrock and Vanguard, [both supported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-06/why-wall-street-s-finally-pushing-to-add-women-on-boards) at least five shareholder diversity proposals in 2017.

#### Why is this important?

Diversity has proven to be [critical to success](http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/climate/diversity/2017/11/30/drilling-diversity.html) in politics or business because it allows governments and organizations to integrate new points of view. Diversity of insights allows organizations and governments to better manage risk, anticipate and quickly adapt to change, and innovate. Diversity also ensures that the government or business is inclusive in that every stakeholder’s concerns are heard and considered in decision-making. After all, how can a company provide good maternity benefits if there are no women in its board? The topic wouldn’t simply come up, would it?

**POLLUTION**

### Crime and punishment: Polluters in China pay up

China’s environment ministry announced today that fines collected from companies that have violated environmental regs for the first 10 months of the year jumped by 48% in 2017 from last year. The ministry collected fines totalling 1.02 billion yuan ($154 million) this year for violations like illegal dumping of waste, exceeding emissions caps or tampering with monitoring equipment, reported the [South China Morning Post](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2123085/steep-rise-fines-chinese-polluters). Chinese companies or individuals are levied a daily fine until they rectify their behavior.

#### Why does this matter?

While environmental protections are slowly being eased in the US under the Trump administration, China has been the raising the bar on the enforcement of its environmental regulations. This year alone, China carried out four intensive ministerial-level inspections of the enforcement of environmental laws. At least 18,000 companies had been [penalized](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2109342/top-level-china-pollution-inspections-wrapping) for environmental violations as of August 2017, and more than 12,000 government officials disciplined for failure to properly enforce regulations.

#### Our take

Having neglected the environmental for so long in the name of development, China does have a lot of cleaning up to do to. Gotta give it some love for trying really hard.
