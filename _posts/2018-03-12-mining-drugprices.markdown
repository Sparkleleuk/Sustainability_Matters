### Mining industry goes after mining ban near Grand Canyon

Two mining industry associations are <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/377956-uranium-industry-takes-challenge-of-grand-canyon-mining-ban-to" target="_blank">
asking the Supreme Court</a> to review a blanket mining ban on public lands next to a national monument. The American Exploration and Mining Association (AEMA) and the National Mining Association (NMA) are questioning the Department of Interior’s “unfettered power to make large-tract withdrawals from mineral extractions”. The groups are specifically challenging a 20-year mining ban on 1 million acres of public land next to the Grand Canyon.

#### Throwback Monday

The <a href="https://www.blm.gov/or/regulations/files/FLPMA.pdf" target="_blank">Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976</a> gives the Department of Interior the mandate to manage public lands including national parks and national monuments. Mining is generally banned in public lands near national monuments. The Interior Department imposed a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2012/01/09/144912580/20-year-ban-put-on-mining-claims-near-grand-canyon" target="_blank">20-year mining ban</a> covering 1 million acres of public land next to the Grand Canyon in 2012 because of the risk that mining operations would contaminate the Colorado River,  a major source of drinking water. A federal court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-grandcanyon/u-s-court-upholds-grand-canyon-uranium-mining-ban-but-allows-mine-nearby-idUSKBN1E62LO" target="_blank">upheld the ban</a> in December 2017.

#### Why does this matter?

Public lands in southern Utah have historically been rich in uranium, but is also home to American Indian tribes. National parks and contiguous lands are protected from resource extraction to prevent environmental damage as well as preserve areas that are sacred to the native tribes. The mining industry has sought to have the ban on uranium mining near the Grand Canyon lifted, but has faced roadblocks in court.

#### Our take

Mining firms appear to have been emboldened by President Trump’s decision to reduce the Big Ears national monument by more than 80% and are pushing the limits by going to the Supreme Court. Extractive firms stand a greater chance of getting access to these lands under this administration than at any other time in recent history, so even if they are defeated in their latest appeal, they may still get what they want from the White House.

### Cost of cholesterol treatment dropped by 50%

Two drug companies, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, have announced that they are willing to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/regeneron-pharms-sanofi-cholesterol-pric/update-1-regeneron-sanofi-offer-new-praluent-pricing-to-break-reimbursement-logjam-idUSL1N1QS03Q" target="_blank">cut the price of a cholesterol drug</a> by approximately 50% if insurers increase access for high-risk patients. The two companies, which sell the Praluent cholesterol drug at a cost equivalent to $14,000 a year, are cutting the cost to $4,500 to $8,000 as recommended by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a third-party reviewer of drug value and pricing.

#### Why does this matter?

Because highly priced drugs affect access to critical drugs for all but the wealthiest Americans, and insurance companies have been rejecting claims for some of these drugs, including Praluent. Yet recent clinical trial results for Praluent showed that it helps reduce the risk of a heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular problems by 24%. The decision to cut prices in exchange for access puts the ball on the insurance industry's court. We think this could be a gamechanger in increasing access to healthcare.

How “Made in Ethiopia” is becoming the new norm in fast fashion. Lured by cheap labor and tax incentives, Asian manufacturing companies are setting up shop in Ethiopia for brands like H&M, Levi’s and Guess, among others. The investment has created jobs, but also raises issues such as land-grabbing from poor farmers and labor abuse. Some things are just too good to be true. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-02/china-is-turning-ethiopia-into-a-giant-fast-fashion-factory" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
