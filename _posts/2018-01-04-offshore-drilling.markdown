### Trump to reopen US coasts to offshore drilling

The Trump administration is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-04/trump-seen-urging-all-u-s-coastal-waters-be-opened-to-drilling" target="_blank">proposing to allow offshore drilling</a> in all coastal waters in the US. The Department of Interior wants to sell leases in 25 out of the 26 offshore planning areas in the US, covering 90% of the US outer continental shelf. The government is planning to open the Arctic and the Eastern seaboard to oil and gas exploration for the first time, including in areas with fragile ecosystems.

#### What's the angle?

From Trump's POV, allowing oil and gas drilling in the US reduces America's reliance on foreign oil. He thinks America is too dependent on foreigners and needs to be self-sufficient.

But <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_imports" target="_blank">according to the US Energy Information Agency</a>, imported petroleum accounts for just 25% of US consumption. Petroleum produced domestically accounts for approximately 75% of US consumption. And even imports are shrinking. The EIA has noted that foreign imports have declined since 2005. Imports from the Persian Gulf and OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) have decreased, although imports from Canada have increased. 

#### In the meantime...

Opening US coasts to offshore drilling increases environmental risks to marine life, especially those with fragile ecosystems. Governors and environmental advocates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/climate/trump-offshore-drilling.html?_r=0" target="_blank">oppose offshore drilling</a> and many environmentalists have fought hard against it for decades.

#### Our take

If imports have been declining in the first place, is energy sufficiency worth the long-term risk to the environment?
