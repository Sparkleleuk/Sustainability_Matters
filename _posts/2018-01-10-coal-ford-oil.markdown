### Coal expected to go south

Coal production in the US is expected to go down for the next two years, according to the US Energy Information Administration's (EIA) short-term outlook released on January 9. The EIA said that while coal production increased in 2017 due to higher demand in international markets, it is expected to decline by 2% in 2018 and 2019 due to a slowdown in exports and low natural gas prices. Electricity generation from coal is also expected to drop below 30% in 2018 and 28% in 2019, while the share of natural gas in electricity generation is expected to grow to 33$ in 2018 and 34% in 2019. Meanwhile, the share of nonhydropower renewables in electricity generation is expected to grow to 11% in 2018 from 10% in 2017.

#### But US carbon emissions are rising

The EIA noted that while <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser/#/?v=5&f=A&s=&start=2014&end=2019&id=&maptype=0&ctype=linechart&linechart=GDPQXUS&chartindexed=0" target="_blank">energy-related CO2 emissions</a> declined by 1% in 2017, they are forecast to increase by 1.7% in 2018 and by 0.2% in 2019. Emissions from petroleum and natural gas have been increasing, contributing to the forecast rise in total emissions in the next two years. Emissions from coal has been declining over time due to lower production and energy generation.

#### ELI5

All these figures essentially mean that despite President Trump's big promise to make coal great again, coal production and consumption by utilities is facing a slow but imminent demise. EIA <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data/browser/#/?v=18&f=A&s=&id=&maptype=0&ctype=linechart" target="_blank">figures</a> show that a steady drop in the volume of coal produced, consumed and stored since 2014. Natural gas, meanwhile, has been the energy darling for the last five years largely due to the fracking boom.

#### Our take

Coal is the dirtiest source of energy and its decline is generally good for the environment and our health. But with emissions forecast to increase in the next couple of years, reducing coal use is just part of the solution. The use of cleaner forms of energy, like renewables, need to increase too.

### NYC sues Big Oil

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-city-sues-big-oil-companies_us_5a564c62e4b03bc4d03d4de8" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit</a> against the world's largest oil companies for their alleged contribution to global warming. The lawsuit was filed against BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, and is seeking compensation for damages to the city's infrastructure caused by climate change.

#### Double whammy

This lawsuit follows an announcement by the city government that the New York City pension fund would be <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/022-18/climate-action-mayor-comptroller-trustees-first-in-the-nation-goal-divest-from#/0" target="_blank">divesting from oil companies</a> over five years. New York City's five pension funds hold approximately $5 billion worth of stock in oil companies. The Big Apple is accusing the oil industry of deception over the impacts of fossil fuels on the climate.

#### Why this Matters

New York City joins <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-usa-oil-climatesuits/california-cities-sue-big-oil-firms-over-climate-change-idUSKCN1BV2QM" target="_blank">San Francisco, Oakland and other counties in California</a> that have filed lawsuits against Big Oil. Similarly, the states of Massachusetts and New York are investigating Exxon Mobil for possibly misleading investors over climate effects of fossil fuels. It's difficult to say if the cities are going to get their way, particularly on their billion dollar claims, as these legal actions are unprecedented. But what is clear is American cities are sending a message to the oil industry to reduce the environmental footprint of their products and support climate action. Do you copy, Big Oil?

### Ford facing dieselgate allegations

Ford truck owners have <a href="http://www.autonews.com/article/20180110/oem11/180119980/ford-sued-diesel-emissions-litigation" target="_blank">sued the truck and car maker for alleging rigging truck engines</a> to beat carbon emissions tests. The lawsuit claimed that Ford marketed its F-250 and F-350 Super Duty diesel pickups as the "cleanest super diesel ever" but its emissions are 50 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide pollutants. Ford denied the allegations, saying that its trucks do not use "defeat devices" and comply with all environmental regulations.

#### What's dieselgate again?

In 2015, Volkwagen admitted to using engine software to beat carbon emissions tests by the US. Thus, the term "dieselgate" was born. Since then, a number of automobile companies have been found or are being investigated for similar allegations.

#### Why is this important?

This is important because this means that cars equipped with defeat devices have a higher negative environmental impact than previously disclosed. Moreover, dishonesty by a company speaks to unsustainable business practices that can only lead to financial risks for the company and its shareholders. No one escapes unscathed.
