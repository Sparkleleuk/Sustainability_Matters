### Heat wave of 2016 killed a third of the Great Barrier Reef

A heat wave in Australia in 2016 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/world/australia/australia-barrier-reef.html" target="_blank">killed 30% of the corals in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)</a>, scientists said. The damage is also irreversible. A spike in temperatures in Australia from March to November 2016 caused a "catastrophic die-off" on the northern part of the reef. "The coral die-off has caused radical changes in the mix of coral species on hundreds of individual reefs, where mature and diverse reef communities are being transformed into more degraded systems, with just a few tough species remaining," said co-author Prof Andrew Baird of Coral CoE at James Cook University in a <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-04-global-great-barrier-reef.html#jCp" target="_blank">press release</a>.

#### What is the GBR?

The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest reef system with more than 2,900 individual reef and 900 islands. It is roughly the size of the state of Texas, or bigger than the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Switzerland combined. It is home to thousands of animal species, and 10% of the world's total fish species. Corals, in general, require warm water to thrive, but are extremely sensitive to heat. An increase of two or three degrees Fahrenheit above normal can kill them.

#### Why does this matter?

Coral reefs are important because they protect coastal areas from the effects of waves and tropical storms. They also provide essential nutrients for marine life and help convert carbon dioxide to organic carbon. (Google this: photosynthesis). In other words, reefs help mitigate global warming.

#### Warning: Beware of carbon emissions

Scientists say that if carbon emissions continue to grow, the reef will be unrecognizable in 50 years. The GBR is unlikely to die away soon but may be a different type of ecosystem if the remaining corals (and there are still plenty of them) are not protected.
