### Nearly 300 companies pledge to reduce plastic waste

A total of 290 organizations have pledged to reduce plastic waste by 2025. The New Plastics Economic Global Commitment was signed by governments, non-profit organizations and private companies including those that represent 20% of all plastic packaging produced globally.

#### What did they commit to?

At the minimum, the signatories <a href="https://newplasticseconomy.org/assets/doc/global-commitment-download.pdf" target="_blank">committed</a> to eliminate unnecessary plastic packaging including single-use plastics; use plastic packaging that are 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable; and circulating plastic produced to keep them out of landfills and oceans. Their commitments will be under review every two years.

#### Who are the signatories?

There are 290 of them including Danone, H&M group, L’Oréal, Mars, PepsiCo, Carrefour, Colgate-Palmolive, The Coca-Cola Company, and Unilever. Major plastic producers also said "we're in this together" and signed the pledge. Check out the complete list of signatories <a href="https://newplasticseconomy.org/projects/global-commitment/signatories#whos-involved" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Why is this important?

Because the problem with plastics is now a "planetary crisis" according to the United Nations. Plastics fill up landfills and clog oceans, killing wildlife and impacting biodiversity. According to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, just 14% to 18% of waste plastics are recycled, 24% is thermally treated and the rest - or more than 50% - go to landfills, are openly burned, or are dumped in waterways and oceans. Reducing plastic use is, therefore, long overdue. So the next time you go shopping, bring your reusable totes and say no to plastic bags. Your little way of helping end this crisis.

**WE'RE CLOSELY WATCHING**

#### **A planned protest by Google employees**

Around 1,500 Google employees, mostly women, are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-29/google-workers-plan-walkout-to-protest-handling-of-executive-misconduct?cmpid=BBD103118_GBIZ&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=181031&utm_campaign=goodbiz" target="_blank">reportedly planning</a> to walk out of their desks tomorrow to protest how management handled allegations of sexual harassment by male Google execs. Remember that Google let go of some top execs over sexual harassment claims, but sent them off with a golden parachute. Some Googlers are unhappy about it. And why are we watching this? Because protests in a tech company are rare and this protest could very well signal that a culture shift is starting.
