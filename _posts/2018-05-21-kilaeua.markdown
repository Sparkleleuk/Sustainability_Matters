### Emissions from Kilauea eruption reaches hazardous levels

Lava from the Kilauea volcano has started to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/21/612969472/hawaii-volcanos-lava-spews-laze-of-toxic-gas-and-glass-into-the-air?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=npr&utm_term=nprnews&utm_content=20180521" target="_blank">pour into the Pacific Ocean</a>, emitting increased levels of hydrochloric acid and steam with fine glass particles, also known as 'laze'. Lava entered the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Big Island two days after Kilauea erupted, and the corrosive gas mixture produced by the lava hitting the ocean resulted in two deaths over the weekend.

#### What does 'laze' do?

'Laze' is a combination of lava and haze, and is formed when hot lava hits the ocean. The Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency warned that laze can cause lung, eye and skin irritation. Laze plume can travel with the wind and can change direction without warning. Moreover, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/20/us/hawaii-kilauea-volcano-lava-flow/index.html" target="_blank">sulfur dioxide emissions have tripled</a> in recent days, according to the Hawaii Volcano Observatory. Sulfur dioxide concentrations cause respiratory problems in humans, and can damage tree and plant foliage.

#### Why does this matter?

The impacts of Kilauea's eruption are expanding and are now posing serious threat to human health and the environment. If you're in the Big Island, be careful out there.

#### **We're reading**

A groundbreaking report that while all 7.6 billion of us earthlings comprise just 0.01% of all living things on Earth, our impact on all other living beings is disproportionately large. Since the dawn of human civilization, 83% of wild animals and 50% of plants have been lost. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/human-race-just-001-of-all-life-but-has-destroyed-over-80-of-wild-mammals-study" target="_blank">Read it to believe it.</a>
