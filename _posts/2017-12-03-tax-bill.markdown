### Senate gives the oil industry more love

The Senate tax bill passed Senate floor deliberations in the early morning of December 2, and along with permanent tax cuts for corporations, senators also okay-ed the following provisions:

* [Opening up](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/11/the-environmental-disaster-tucked-into-the-tax-bill/) of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Oil drilling would be allowed within a 1.5 acre portion of the refuge, also known as the 1002 Area.

* [Investment tax credits](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-new-tax-solar-wind-20171202-story.html) for wind and solar plants would be treated as income and would be subject to tax.

* [Elimination](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-new-tax-solar-wind-20171202-story.html) of $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.

* [Lower tax rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/business/tax-bill-offers-last-minute-breaks-for-developers-banks-and-oil-industry.html?_r=0) for certain income of oil and gas companies.

#### Stay woke

Most of us were deep in slumber when the Senate hastily passed the Republican tax plan. But what we're seeing is a systematic reversal of climate-friendly policies instituted by previous US administrations. This matters because the US has one of the highest carbon emissions in the world and all the love being given to the fossil fuel industry further [slows down](http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/climate/ethics/csr/2017/11/10/offcourse1.html) the world's ability to minimize the impact of global warming. The tax plan also has numerous provisions that [disadvantage](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2017-11-30/these-clauses-in-the-gop-tax-bill-may-surprise-you) ordinary taxpayers, including cuts in the health and social insurance programs.

The Senate and House of Representatives need to reconcile their two versions and come up with one version by December 8. But with both houses of congress dominated by Republicans, all the provisions of this plan have a high likelihood of being passed and signed into law.
