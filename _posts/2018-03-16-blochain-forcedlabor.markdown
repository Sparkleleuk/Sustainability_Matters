### Blockchain project against labor violations

Beverage company, Coca-Cola and the US State Department said they will <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blockchain-coca-cola-labor/coca-cola-u-s-state-department-to-use-blockchain-to-combat-forced-labor-idUSKCN1GS2PY" target="_blank">use blockchain to combat forced labor</a>. The project involves the use of blockchainâ€™s digital ledger technology to create a secure registry for workers. Coke said it wants to increase transparency and efficiency of the verification process of its labor supply chain.

#### What brought this on?

Food and beverage companies, most of which source raw materials from developing countries, have been criticized for inadequate action to stop the use of forced labor by its suppliers. A <a href="https://knowthechain.org/benchmarks/2/" target="_blank">report by non-profit Know the Chain</a> showed that Unilever performed better than peers in terms of supply chain management, while Monster Beverage was the worst.

#### Why does this matter?

Because it presents an opportunity to use the latest technology to reduce social risks of companies. Certainly technology alone, no matter how shiny it looks, is not going to solve the problem of forced labor; a lot depends on human factors too. But it may help reduce forced labor by making it harder for suppliers to hide and for companies to spot problems before they get worse.
