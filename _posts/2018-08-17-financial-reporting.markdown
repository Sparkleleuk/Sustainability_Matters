### Six-month reporting favored to replace quarterly cycle

President Trump said on August 17 that he wants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look into <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-trump/trump-backs-ceos-proposes-easing-corporate-reporting-rules-idUSKBN1L217G?il=0" target="_blank">replacing quarterly financial reporting</a> with a bi-annual cycle. In a tweet, Trump said that his meetings with chief executives has convinced him that a bi-annual cycle would give companies more flexibility and reduce compliance costs.

#### The basics

US-domiciled corporations and those listed in US stock exchanges are required to report on their financial performance every quarter. In contrast, European and UK regulators require six-month reporting. Regular financial reporting is necessary for investors to determine how a company is doing after each reporting period. The company's disclosure is used by financial analysts to make forecasts, which inform the prices of the company's stocks, bonds and other financial instruments traded in the market.

#### What's wrong with three?

Quarterly reporting has been criticized for promoting "short-termism" among company executives. Critics, who include pension funds and CEOs themselves, say this inhibits companies from investing in long-term but high-impact and sustainable activities for fear that these will affect quarterly performance. And quarterly reporting is costly, there's a LOT of work that goes into producing 8-Ks and other regulatory filings every three months.

#### But others want to stick to it

The Council of Institutional Investors thinks replacing quarterly reporting is not a good idea, saying that investors need timely and transparent reporting to be able to make investment decisions. Others say quarterly reporting "support richer U.S. stock valuations, and that a change could make shares more volatile."

#### What do CEOs think?

They're all for it. Just ask Warren Buffet (the oracle of Omaha), Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase chief), Indra Nooyi (outgoing Pepsico CEO) and even Elon Musk (Tesla founder). CEOs also feel the pressure of the capital markets and want the markets to give them some slack.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, short-termism. But then you know that already.
