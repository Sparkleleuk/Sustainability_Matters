### California's net neutrality rules are the "strongest" in the nation

California lawmakers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/01/643909884/california-lawmakers-pass-net-neutrality-bill" target="_blank">passed</a> last week the state's net neutrality rules in a move that is expected to put the state at odds with the largest internet service providers. The state Senate passed the bill by a vote of 27-12 while the House of Representatives voted 61-18.

#### What's net neutrality again?

Net neutrality is a set of rules that ensures equal access of web content regardless of fees paid by the user, or of internet service provider (ISP). It prevents ISPs like Verizon, Comcast or Time Warner from prioritizing websites, ensuring a level playing field for all content regardless of size and market influence.

#### What's the California version?

The bill, which has yet to be signed by Governor Jerry Brown, <a href="http://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/20180831-senator-wiener%E2%80%99s-bill-enact-strongest-net-neutrality-protections-nation-passes" target="_blank">prohibits</a> blocking websites, speeding up or slowing down websites or whole classes of applications such as video. ISPs are prohibited from circumventing these protections at the point where data enters their networks and from charging access fees to reach ISP customers. ISPs are also banned from violating net neutrality by not counting the content and websites they own against subscribersâ€™ data caps. Senator Scott Weiner, who sponsored the bill, said California will have the "strongest net neutrality standards" in the country.

#### Why did California enact its own rules?

Because the federal government repealed them despite protests by consumer rights groups. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed net neutrality rules in December 2017 because they were "heavy-handed". In response, state governments started enacting their own rules. States such as Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Montana, Rhode Island, Vermont, Oregon and Washington enacted their own rules following the FCC decision.

#### Why does this matter?

Rules set by state governments are actually more impactful because ISPs need state government approval to be able to do business in each state. Net neutrality rules at state level effectively render the federal repeal moot and academic. Expect lawsuits from ISPs but in the meantime, seems like consumers are having the last laugh after all.
