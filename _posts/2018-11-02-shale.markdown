### Gas is now flowing from the UK's only shale gas field

The operator of the United Kingdom's only operating shale gas field said <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-46075799" target="_blank">gas is now flowing</a> from the field, a few weeks after operations at the site resumed.  

#### Didn't know the UK has shale gas...

Onshore shale gas production in the UK was proposed in 2007 and in 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne reportedly said he wanted Britain to be a leader in shale gas production. The British government has awarded more than 100 licenses for shale gas exploration all over the country but only one field, operated by energy firm, Cuadrilla, is operational. Shale gas drilling in Lancashire started in 2011 but was suspended after tremors were experienced in the area. Environmental advocates have been actively protesting the resumption of drilling.

#### Why is shale gas controversial?

Shale gas is extracted through <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-14432401" target="_blank">fracking</a>, which is opposed for its environmental impacts. Fracking has also been linked to earthquakes in the area where the fracking takes place.

#### What's in it for the UK?

A bit more of energy independence because the UK imports gas from other parts of Europe. The Lancashire field has <a href="https://www.bgs.ac.uk/research/energy/shaleGas/bowlandShaleGas.html" target="_blank">reserves of about 1,329 trillion cubic feet</a>. It's a lot smaller than reserves in say, the US and China, but supporters are hopeful it will reduce energy dependence on countries such as Russia.

#### Why does this matter?

The commercialization of shale gas from the Lancashire field could lead to further shale gas drilling in the rest of the country, increasing the negative environmental consequences of fracking.

**ICYMI**

#### **New opioid approved**

The opioid epidemic in the US has been declared a public health emergency, yet the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved yet another opioid that is more potent than the ones currently in the market. The FDA approved Dsuvia, a synthetic opioid that is 10 times stronger than fentanyl, which has been abused in recent years.
