### "Unprecedented" number of animals die in Florida red tide

<a href="https://weather.com/science/environment/news/2018-07-28-florida-fort-myers-red-tide-dead-animals-turtles" target="_blank">"Droves" of animals have died</a> and washed ashore in southwestern Florida beaches from what environmentalists say is the worst red tide in Florida since 2006. Environmentalists said an "unprecedented" number of sea turtles as well as birds, ducks, manatees, tarpons and other marine animals.

#### What causes red tide?

Red tide is caused by a large concentration of aquatic microorganisms - or algal bloom. Algal bloom is seasonal and is a natural phenomenon. But water pollution and systemic increase in sea water temperatures may trigger excessive bloom, which seems to be the case in Florida. The red tide coincides with extreme heat experienced in most parts of the continental US.

#### Why does this matter?

Because toxic algae impacts marine life and biodiversity, and can affect human health. It may trigger respiratory diseases and allergies. Last week, the National Weather Service issued a red tide beach hazard warning for three coastal counties, a signal that the red tide has reached dangerous levels. Is it the end of beach season?

**ICYMI**

#### California wildfires continue to spread

The wildfires in Northern California have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fires-20180730-story.html" target="_blank">destroyed close to 200,000 acres</a> (81,000 hectares) as of July 30, and killed at least eight people. The fires destroyed thousands of structures and burned down trees in the Yosemite National Park. As of July 30, there are four active wildfires in the area with less than 30% contained. The fires have affected air quality in the area.

#### Of volcanoes and earthquakes

Last week, approximately <a href="https://weather.com/news/news/2018-07-27-vanuatu-ambae-manaro-volcano-eruption-evacuations-emergency" target="_blank">10,000 people were evacuated</a> from the tiny Pacific island of Ambae in Vanuatu after the Manaro Volcano started to erupt. On July 29, an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/30/asia/lombok-earthquake-indonesia-emergency-intl/index.html" target="_blank">intensity 6.4 earthquake</a> hit Lombok island in Indonesia. More than 700 hikers were trapped when the earthquake triggered a landslide in Mount Rinjani, a popular hiking destination. The Pacific Ring of Fire sure is on fire.
