### Former Googler says she was repeatedly sexually harassed

A former Google employee has a filed a lawsuit against Google, claiming that the company failed to adequately address repeated harassment by male co-workers. The former employee, a software engineer, claimed that "she was targeted by lewd comments and ogled, that male co-workers spiked her drinks with alcohol with one asking her for a "horizontal hug" and another slapping her while intoxicated," according to a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/26/google-diversity-culture-war/1071107001/" target="_blank">report by USA Today</a>. She also claimed that her co-workers refused to approve the code she wrote, leading to her being labeled as a "poor performer". She was fired from Google in February 2016 after eight years of employment, for "poor performance". She also said that the human resources department found her claims to be "unsubstantiated".

#### What's the angle?

This is not the first harassment-related lawsuit against Google. Google is facing a lawsuit by women who claim that they were paid less than men, and is under investigation by the Department of Labor for "systematic compensation disparities against women". A former employee who wrote a controversial memo expressing a bias against women and minority engineers has also filed a lawsuit, claiming that Google did not do enough to protect him from harassment. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/" target="_blank">number of employees</a> have also alleged that Google's actions against harassment are inadequate.

#### What's Google's stand?

Google says it has "strong policies" against harassment, that it reviews "every complaint" it receives and that it takes action when it finds violations.  

#### Our take

The accusations against Google fit a pattern of allegations against Silicon Valley companies. The tech industry has been accused of promoting a "bro" culture that in many ways, tolerates inappropriate behavior against women. Think Uber under former CEO Travis Kalanick. While it may not end up experiencing Uber's woes (we can't just boycott Google and Gmail after all) it is facing a watershed moment and all these allegations could end up hurting the company more than it thinks they can. Google campuses may seem like  a playground for young professionals, but it's not all fun and games in Google.

### Dick's Sporting Goods, Walmart impose limits on gun sales

Sports chain Dick's Sporting Goods today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/dicks-major-gun-retailer-will-stop-selling-assault-style-rifles.html" target="_blank">announced</a> it will stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines in all its stores. Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart are also raising the age limit for any gun buyer to 21 years old, regardless of local laws.

#### What does this matter?

The decision by the two large retailers reduces access to high-powered rifles that have been used in mass shootings in the country. Raising the age limit also reduces the chances of teenagers and young adults getting access to firearms in general.

#### Our take

The financial impact of these limits on both Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart are expected to be minimal as gun sales have gone down in recent years anyway. Thus, it's made things easier for both retailers to impose these restrictions. Nonetheless, their announcements send yet another strong signal that even the business community is finally taking notice of the perils of unrestricted gun ownership.
