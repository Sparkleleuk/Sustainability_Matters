### Pharma companies told to hear resolutions on drug cost

Five pharmaceutical companies have been <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/03/25/sec-biogen-cant-block-shareholder-vote-on-drug.html" target="_blank">told by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> to admit shareholder resolutions on drug pricing in their annual shareholder meetings. The SEC rejected the appeal by Biogen, AbbVie, Amgen, Bristol-Myers, and Eli Lilly to omit the proposals from their annual shareholders' meetings, instead saying, "nope, you gotta hear them". Shareholders filed resolutions urging the companies to report to investors whether there is a link between executive compensation and high drug prices.

#### ELI5: What are shareholder resolutions?

Shareholder resolutions are submitted by investors for a vote during a company's annual general meeting. These resolutions are typically non-binding, which means that companies are not legally obliged to fulfill them. However, resolutions are regulated by the SEC and the SEC can compel companies to hear resolutions filed by their investors. Resolutions typically relate to corporate governance as well as environmental and social issues, and while companies usually oppose these resolutions, "yes" votes put pressure on executive management to act on them.

#### Why this matters

Investors are asking the five companies to report in their next annual meeting any link between incentive structures and drug prices. In short, they are concerned that executives are incentivized to raise drug prices to boost their bonuses. We should be concerned too because drug prices in the US contribute to seriously high medical cost of healthcare. To be sick in America is to face the risk of going bankrupt.

#### Our take

Pharma companies are increasingly being criticized for having business models that rely on high drug prices rather than on innovation. Think <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/10/31/valeant-scandal/" target="_blank">Valeant</a> and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/after-years-of-price-gouging-mylans-epipen-gets-crushed-2017-3" target="_blank">Mylan</a> scandals. It's time that the industry stops skirting the issue and actually face up to it. Lives are at stake here.
