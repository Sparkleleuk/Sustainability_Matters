### Federal court wants an unprecedented lesson on climate change

A federal judge in San Francisco has requested a <a href="https://rclutz.wordpress.com/2018/03/03/cal-court-to-hear-climate-tutorial/" target="_blank">"tutorial" on climate change</a> from parties involved in lawsuits filed by two cities against five oil companies. US District Court Judge William Alsup issued a “Notice re Tutorial” for a two-part tutorial on global warming and climate change on March 21. Part 1 will "trace the history of scientific study of climate change (read: from ice age to present)" while part 2 "will set forth the best science now available on global warming, glacier melt, sea rise, and coastal flooding."

#### Why does this matter?

Because this request is unprecedented and gives both sides an opportunity to present concrete evidence on global warming in a legal venue. Everyone, from oil industry supporters, to environmental advocates and legal experts are claiming victory over this notice.

#### What are they saying?

<a href="http://mfgaccountabilityproject.org/2018/03/05/momentum-building-sham-lawsuits/" target="_blank">Oil industry supporters</a> think that having a federal court try the lawsuits filed by the cities of Oakland and San Francisco dooms these legal actions. <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article203842084.html" target="_blank"> Environmental advocates</a> say this will put oil companies on the spot and will force them to go on record on their understanding of climate change. Legal experts say this is the closest that the US has to having a public discussion on climate science and is generally a good idea.

#### Our take

We think so too. It's about time that climate change is discussed in a wider context with real evidence presented by all parties. It's time we move past the fake news on a topic with grave consequences for everyone.
