### Novartis, AT&T paid for access and advice on Trump

Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis and US telecommunications firm AT&T <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-10/at-t-novartis-ties-to-cohen-reveal-backdoor-bids-to-reach-trump" target="_blank">paid a total of $2 million</a> to President Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to gain insights and advice on Trump's policies. The payments were revealed as part of the Russia investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller.

#### Backchannel

Novartis <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/novartis-paid-trumps-lawyer-michael-cohen-more-than-1-million-for-work-he-was-unable-to-do-company-says.html" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that it paid Cohen $100,000 per month starting February 2017 to gain insights into Trump's health care policies, while AT&T sought advice over its stalled merger with Time Warner. Both companies indicated that they did not get their money's worth from Cohen and terminated their contracts.

#### Caught with their pants down

In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/10/we-made-a-mistake-novartis-ceo-tells-employees.html" target="_blank">internal email to staff</a> sent today, Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan admitted that the company "made a mistake" in making a deal with Cohen. "We made a mistake in entering into this engagement and, as a consequence, are being criticized by a world that expects more from us," he wrote.

#### Our take

While the use of external consultants is not illegal, the contracts leave a fishy taste in the mouth. It shows that the companies tried to pay their way to gain unfair advantage over other companies. According to political spending database <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=H04&year=2017" target="_blank">Open Secrets</a>, Novartis spent nearly $8.8 million in lobbying in 2017, making it one of the top political spenders in the pharmaceutical industry. But obviously that figure does not count money spent on fixers like Cohen. It's a messy business.

#### **Quote of the day: Wrong on all counts**

<em>The agency failed to listen to the American public and gave short shrift to their deeply held belief that internet openness should remain the law of the land. The FCC is on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of the law, and the wrong side of the American people. </em> ~ FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. Net neutrality expires on June 11. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet/fcc-says-net-neutrality-rules-will-end-in-june-idUSKBN1IB1UN" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
