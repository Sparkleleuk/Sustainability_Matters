### Googlers say "enough is enough"

Thousands of Google employees today walked out of their job to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations. Googlers from Asia to the US protested in droves, the turnout was higher than the 1,500 employees expected. The protest followed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html" target="_blank">New York Times story</a> about how the company protected a top exec who was accused of sexual harassment. 

#### The demands

So employees didn't just walk out to protest. They had demands too. The organizers of the Google Walkout want the following: an end to forced arbitration for sexual harassment and discrimination cases; a commitment to end pay and opportunity inequity; a publicly disclosed sexual harassment transparency report; a clear, uniform, globally inclusive process for reporting sexual misconduct safely and anonymously; promotion of the Chief Diversity Officer to answer directly to the CEO; appointment of an Employee Representative to the Board.

#### How is Google responding?

CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/01/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-we-didnt-always-get-it-right.html" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> that "there's anger and frustration within the company. We all feel it. I feel it too." He says the company is "committed to doing better" with how to handle sexual misconduct and discrimination.

#### Why is this important?

This is the largest public protest by employees of a tech company and sends a signal that things are changing in Silicon Valley. Locker room behavior is no longer going to be tolerated by co-workers. Change is coming, whether the young white male likes it or not.
