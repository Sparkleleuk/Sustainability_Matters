### Flooding in Kerala kills up to 350, affects 800,000 people

Kerala state in southern India is experiencing its <a href="https://weather.com/news/news/2018-08-19-india-monsoon-flooding-kerala-displaced" target="_blank">worst flooding</a> in a century. Flooding caused by heavy monsoon rains has led to the death of up to 350 people, according to some media estimates, and has displaced approximately 800,000 others who have taken shelter in around 4,000 relief camps across the state. Scores of animals have also been killed.

#### Tell me more

The monsoon season in south Asia typically brings about heavy rains and usually causes flooding in many parts of the region. But officials say the downpours that started on August 8 were more than the typical monsoon rainfall. Damage from the flooding is now estimated at nearly $3 billion and approximately 6,000 miles of roads and other infrastructure are believed to have been destroyed.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, extreme weather. While most of the northern hemisphere have been baking under intense heat and dryness, India experienced an extremely wet summer that has endangered human lives and infrastructure. Unusual times indeed.
