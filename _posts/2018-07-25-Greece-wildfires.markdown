### At least 80 killed in wildfires

At least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/world/europe/greece-wildfire.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank">80 people have reportedly been killed in wildfires</a> that swept across a village in southern Greece early this week. The wildfires occurred in the village of Mati, a vacation spot east of Athens, on July 23. The first fire spread quickly across the area due to high winds. This year's fires were the deadliest since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/world/europe/26greece.html" target="_blank">wildfires struck the Peloponnesian Peninsula in 2007</a>, killing at least 60 people.

#### Greece wasn't the only one this summer

Europe, North America and the Middle East experienced severe heat this summer, triggering wildfires from the US west coast to the Arctic Circle. A total of 800 hectares (2,000 acres) of land were destroyed in <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/forest-fires-devastate-western-latvia/a-44780389" target="_blank">five days of fires in western Latvia</a>, while at one point, Sweden battled as many as <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/eu-coordinates-further-assistance-to-help-sweden-fight-forest-fires/a-44774984" target="_blank">80 fires in different parts of the country</a>. Wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/us/fires-california-colorado.html" target="_blank">swept through the US states of California, Colorado and New Mexico</a>, and destroyed parts of the famed Yosemite National Park. According to the European Forest Fire Information System, at least 16 European countries have experienced more wildfires than usual at this time of year compared to previous years.

#### How do wildfires occur?

Wildfires can be triggered by either natural causes such as lightning during dry thunderstorms, or by human activity. For example, a forest fire that killed at least 60 people in Portugal last year was believed to have been <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/portugal-investigates-cause-of-forest-fire-as-death-toll-rises-1.3124520" target="_blank">caused by lightning during a dry thunderstorm</a>. In the US, the National Park Service has determined that 90% of wildfires in the country are <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluations.htm" target="_blank">caused by human activities</a> such as burning of debris, unattended cigarettes and arson. Fires tend to break out quickly in dry areas and can spread rapidly because of high winds.

#### Why does this matter?

Because wildfires threaten lives, property and nature. Moreover, they contribute to climate change because of the release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

### Facebook shares under fire

Facebook's share price <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-stock-crushed-after-revenue-user-growth-miss-2018-07-25" target="_blank">took a dive</a> today after its number of monthly active users fell short of expectations and the company acknowledged that it may continue to experience slower revenue growth.

#### Hit me with the numbers

Facebook reported that its MAU (for Monthly Active Users) stood at 2.23 million as of June 30, 2018, an increase of 11% from the same period last year. Well and good. But this figure was lower than analyst expectations and user growth was flat in North America and fell in Europe in the second quarter of 2018. Moreover, while sales increased by 41%, this growth was lower than previous quarters and Facebook's CFO warned that the slower growth will continue.

#### What do these mean?

Facebook is now feeling the impact of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Facebook users have pulled back from using the social network and this means lower opportunity to generate ads, which is Facebook's bread and butter. This is a clear reflection of the materiality of data privacy to a business, and the failure to protect private data is a clear and present danger to a company's ability to hold on to its customers.
