### Project sustainable runway

A new report by a British charity, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, has found that the fashion industry is adding to global pollution because of the production of large volumes of cheap and dispensable clothing that are hardly used after a year, and end up getting burned or dumped in landfills. The report noted, "If nothing changes, by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world's carbon budget." It stated that clothes release half a million tons of microfibers, "equivalent to more than 50 billion plastic bottles". The authors offer a vision of sustainable fashion that includes the phaseout of microfibers and similar substances, the production of high quality clothing to encourage longer usage, improving recycling systems, and increasing the use of renewable resources.

The full 150-page report can be accessed in the [Foundation's website](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/news/one-garbage-truck-of-textiles-wasted-every-second-report-creates-vision-for-change). Yes, it's long but should be interesting read for the fashionista in us.

#### Why should we care?

We love to shop, and boy do we love cheap, fashionable clothes. But these clothes are also choking the planet and straining natural resources. The report confirms what previous [studies](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads) have found: that significant quantities of fibers from clothes have been accumulating in shorelines as well as in freshwater, where they can be eaten by small fishes and other marine life. The toxins, in turn, could end up in bigger fishes that prey on smaller fishes, and eventually end up ingested by the top of the food chain: us. More sushi, anyone?

**ETHICS**

### Not again: Wells Fargo may have also duped corporate clients

Employees of Wells Fargo, one of the largest US banks, were reported to have overcharged clients of the bank's foreign exchange (forex) business to inflate their bonuses. The Wall Street Journal reported that just 10% of its fee agreements with forex clients were accurately priced.

#### What is the forex business?

Banks operate forex business units primarily to service corporate and other institutional clients that need foreign exchange for international transactions. Clients may buy foreign currencies or hedge against future foreign exchange fluctuations.

#### I am not a corporation, why is this important?

This matters because just a year ago, Wells Fargo was found to have created fake customer accounts and invented fake customer details also to inflate bonuses. It has been penalized by multiple regulators, but the latest report shows that unethical activity appears pervasive.

#### It's a BFD

Banks run on the trust and goodwill of customers. We entrust our life savings as well as private information to these institutions, and in turn, we expect them to run their business in good faith. If bank employees cheat everyone but their own mothers, then that bank must be seriously effed up.
