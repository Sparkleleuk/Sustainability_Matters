### McDonald's employees hold strike against "rampant" sexual harassment

Employees of fast food chain McDonald's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/18/mcdonalds-workers-strike-over-rampant-sexual-harassment" target="_blank">staged a one-day strike</a> in 10 cities nationwide on September 18 to protest  "rampant" sexual harassment in McDonald's restaurants and franchises. The workers demanded that the company address sexual abuse. The strike targeted restaurants in Durham, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles; Miami; Milwaukee; New Orleans; Orlando, Florida; San Francisco and St. Louis.

#### What's the story?

According to a 2016 survey by Hart Research Associates, 40% of fast food workers reported that they had been sexually harassed. A workers' group <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-complaint-idUSKCN1251YN" target="_blank">said in 2016</a> that it had filed complaints with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on behalf of 15 workers at McDonald's who had been sexually harassed on the job. Thirteen of the sexual harassment complaints were by women, and two were by men. In May 2018, at least 10 more employees filed <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/10-mcdonald-s-workers-file-sex-harassment-claims-n876316" target="_blank">sexual harassment complaints</a> against the fast food giant.

#### All that they want

Workers are demanding that McDonald's form a multi-sectoral committee made up of workers, national advocacy groups, as well as corporate and franchise representatives to address sexual harassment claims and prevent recurrence.

#### And McDonald's says...

“We have policies, procedures and training in place that are specifically designed to prevent sexual harassment at our company and company-owned restaurants, and we firmly believe that our franchisees share this commitment,” according to a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mcdonald-s-workers-go-strike-over-sexual-harassment-n910656" target="_blank">company statement</a>.

#### Why does this matter?

Because low-wage workers are typically more vulnerable to sexual harassment. Studies also found that sexual harassment occur more frequently in workplaces with low-wage workers. Low-wage workers have limited resources to seek redress and in many cases, they remain silent for fear of losing their jobs. In 2017, Ford CEO Jim Hackett apologized to its workers for sexual harassment cases against women workers that went unaddressed for years.

**ICYMI**

#### **Facebook hit for job ad discrimination, again**

A labor union filed a complaint with the EEOC for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45569227" target="_blank">alleged gender discrimination in its job ads</a>. Job ads in traditionally male-dominated professions like mechanic, roofer and security engineer allegedly do not show up in newsfeeds of women. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-is-letting-job-advertisers-target-only-men" target="_blank"> the first time</a> for Facebook, which relies on ads for a living.
