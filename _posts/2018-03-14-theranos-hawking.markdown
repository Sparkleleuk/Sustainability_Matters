### Fraud charges against Theranos founder, exec

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-41 " target="_blank">charged the founder and former president of private start-up Theranos Inc. of “massive” fraud</a>. The SEC accused Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes and former president Ramesh Balwani of perpetuating “an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company’s technology, business, and financial performance.” In short, the SEC told Holmes and Balwani, liar, liar.

#### Good intentions

Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 to “revolutionize” the blood testing industry. The company claimed it could conduct conclusive blood tests by using small amounts of blood from a prick in the finger. It planned to market its portable blood analyzer in pharmacies to democratize access to otherwise costly blood tests. Theranos raised $700 million from investors and became a media darling for several years. It had on its board of directors the likes of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

#### Fall from grace

Theranos's troubles began in 2015 when a series of Wall Street Journal reports cast doubts on its claims. In its charge sheet, the SEC confirmed that Theranos’ blood testing tool “could complete only a small number of tests, and the company conducted the vast majority of patient tests on modified and industry-standards commercial analyzers manufactured by others.” Holmes and Balwani didn't put up a fight. They settled all charges, with Holmes agreeing to pay $500,000 in penalty. She will be barred from serving as director of any company for 10 years, among other conditions.

#### Why does this matter?

Because start-ups can dazzle us with the greatness of their products, and those of us with the money to invest could lose our shirts to shams like Theranos. Investors need to do their own homework and probe the hype, because sometimes, what may seem to be too good to be true may be just that. But on the flip side, the level of interest on Theranos showed there is opportunity for more disruption in the medical testing industry. Perhaps Theranos was just ahead of its time and the technology to democratize blood testing has yet to be developed, but people are tired of expensive healthcare and will welcome solutions that would bring down healthcare cost.

#### **Quotes of the day from Stephen Hawking. RIP.**

<em>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/stephen-hawking-dangerous-time-planet-inequality" target="_blank">automation of factories</a> has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining. This in turn will accelerate the already widening economic inequality around the world. The internet and the platforms that it makes possible allow very small groups of individuals to make enormous profits while employing very few people. This is inevitable, it is progress, but it is also socially destructive.</em>

<em>Perhaps in a few hundred years, we will have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/01/stephen-hawking-dangerous-time-planet-inequality" target="_blank">established human colonies amid the stars</a>, but right now we only have one planet, and we need to work together to protect it.</em>

<em>Remember to <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/professor-stephen-hawking-humanity-wont-survive-1000-years-on-earth-a7417366.html" target="_blank">look up at the stars</a> and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up.</em>
