### Teachers' pensions invested in private prison companies

A teachers' union is calling on managers of pensions funds of public school teachers to divest from companies that operate private prisons, noting that these investments are supporting an "unjust" and "inhumane" immigration policy by the Trump administration. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) released a <a href="https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/invest-risks-prisons-detention-2018.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> identifying three companies that provide services or operate family detention centers: General Dynamics, CoreCivic and the GEO Group and noted that teachers' pensions are invested in these three companies.

#### Name and shame

In its report release this week, the AFT named the asset managers that are invested in at least $10 million worth of shares in the three companies, with General Dynamics receiving the most investment. General Dynamics reportedly has a US government contract to provide case management services to youth detention centers. CoreCivic, formerly Correction Corporation of America, owns and operates eight immigration detention centers, while the GEO Group also operates family detention centers. The GEO Group, however, <a href="https://www.axios.com/immigration-teacher-pensions-private-prison-american-teacher-federation-023f8a03-a316-419c-b1c2-57dc23f1592b.html" target="_blank">denied</a> that it managed facilities housing unaccompanied minors or provided services to such facilities.

#### Why does this matter?

Private prisons are already controversial to begin with, because they have been associated with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/mississippi-private-prison-abuse.html" target="_blank">appalling human rights abuses</a>. These issues have been attributed to low capacity and lack of training by prison personnel due to cost cutting measures. The AFT is rekindling a long-running debate on whether private companies should be allowed to manage prisons, including immigration detention centers that have been used to enforce a "zero tolerance" immigration policy.

The <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/private-prisons-united-states/" target="_blank">report by Sentencing Project</a> would be good start. Then there's the famous <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer/" target="_blank">investigation by reporter Shane Bauer</a> who went undercover as a private prison guard for four months. Not an easy read, parental guidance is advised.

**BEFORE YOU GO...**

#### **Scientists predict a looong hot season**

A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05442-8" target="_blank">global forecasting study</a> says that a "warmer than normal period" is predicted for 2018-2022. The forecast is based on a model that considers the global-mean surface air temperature and sea surface temperature. The study, published on August 14th, says "the coming warm period is associated with an increased likelihood of intense to extreme temperatures." Perhaps winter is not coming after all.
