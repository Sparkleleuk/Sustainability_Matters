### California goes solar

California today became the first US state to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-09/california-votes-to-require-rooftop-solar-power-on-new-homes"  target="_blank">require that new homes be installed with solar panels</a>. The new directive becomes part of the state's energy standards and will take effect for new single-family houses and multifamily units that are three storeys or less built after January 1, 2020. The mandate is part of California's efforts to cut the state's carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.

#### The pros...

California state believes that the new standards would lower greenhouse gas emissions from residential energy use and will save residents money in the long-term. The state hopes that the lower energy bills would offset the increase in housing prices over time. The mandate is also likely to drive up the demand for solar panels, which benefits the solar industry. Approximately 80,000 new homes are added to the state's housing market each year, but only 15,000 includes solar power, so you see the upside.

#### The cons...

The added cost to housing prices is the main concern in an already expensive housing market. Some say it will add roughly add $10k to the cost of a new home. The Golden State is already one of the most expensive states to live in, so an increase in the housing prices is bad news for prospective home owners. Second, some are concerned that it will favor big homebuilders that have more experience offering solar-powered homes. Smaller companies will find it more difficult and costly to fulfill the new requirements.

#### Why does this matter?

California's new standards sets a precedent among other states. If it is successful in lowering energy costs and carbon emissions, other states could very well follow with similar mandates. But the state needs to address the short-term pain of higher housing prices because this standard  could end up useless if no one can afford the new homes.

**ICYMI**

#### **Wimbledon goes straw-less**

If you get thirsty while watching tennis in Wimbledon, you can still grab a beverage but you won't be able to drink it with a plastic straw. Wimbledon has joined several private entities in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/01/last-straw-for-wimbledon-as-tennis-tournament-acts-on-plastic" target="_blank">banning single-use plastics</a>. It will be using recyclable paper straws instead. Match point.
