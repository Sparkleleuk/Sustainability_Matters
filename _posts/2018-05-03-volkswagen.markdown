### Volkswagen's new CEO promises more responsible company

Volkswagen (VW) shareholders today confirmed the appointment of a new CEO who <a href="http://www.cityam.com/285268/new-volkswagen-ceo-herbert-diess-heralds-era-corporate" target="_blank">promised</a> a more responsible company, even as the car maker was criticized for its failure to appoint more independent board members. CEO Herbert Deiss committed to expanding the company's compliance program such as its whistleblowing procedures and supply chain management. Deiss was appointed last month, and takes over the reins of a company that continues to face the legal spotlight since admitting in 2015 to manipulating carbon emissions tests in the US for multiple years. Deiss said VW has to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/vw-ceo-urges-corporate-culture-change-amid-sweeping-revamp" target="_blank">"become more honest, more open, and more truthful"</a>.

#### Tough love from shareholders

But shareholders were not altogether happy with VW. Three prominent shareholder advisers urged investors to vote against the reelection of Wolfgang Porsche, the chairman of VW's parent company, Porsche AG, and the election of Marianne Heiss, noting that they were non-independent and that Porsche mishandled the dieselgate scandal. Shareholders said there is a need to reform corporate governance and change corporate culture.

#### Why does this matter?

Because VW remains one of the largest car makers in the world and its stock is still held by large investors. There is a broad interest among investors and customers to see this company demonstrate that it can prevent recurrence of dieselgate and that it can put its past behind. In the meantime, VW has had to pay <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/vw-ceo-urges-corporate-culture-change-amid-sweeping-revamp" target="_blank">approximately $30 billion</a> in penalties and other legal expenses and continues to face investigations and other legal actions, mostly related to dieselgate. Even for a company of VW's size, $30 billion is massive. And incidentally, the US government <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case" target="_blank">today charged former CEO Martin Winterkorn</a> with conspiracy and fraud for his role in the scandal. The indictment is symbolic as Winterkorn is in Germany and is unlikely to travel to the US or unlikely to be extradited. But that's one way to bring closure to this long-running saga.

**ICYMI**

#### **The most controversial, ever**

The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/scott-pruitt-lobbyist-house.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news" target="_blank">New York Times reported</a> that as of today, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is facing 11 investigations over alleged ethical misconduct, ranging from flying first class to buying a house from the wife of a DC lobbyist. Meanwhile, the EPA has been busy dismantling environmental regulations and undermining science-based arguments about climate change. Anyone up for a bet on how long he will last in office?
