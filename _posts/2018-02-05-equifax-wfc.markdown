### Is Equifax getting away with a serious data breach?

A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-equifax-cfpb/exclusive-u-s-consumer-protection-official-puts-equifax-probe-on-ice-sources-idUSKBN1FP0IZ" target="_blank">Reuters report</a> alleged that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) under a new head may have scaled down an investigation on credit bureau Equifax. The CFPB, under Mick Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Trump last year, has not issued subpoenas or sworn testimonies from Equifax, which are routine procedures during an investigation. Moreover, it appears to have abandoned a plan to conduct tests on Equifax's data protection systems.

#### What happened with Equifax again?

In September 2017, Equifax admitted that hackers breached its information security systems and stole sensitive data, including Social Security Numbers, of approximately 143 million US residents. This is approximately a third of the US population. The admission happened a month after the data breach was discovered but the company was mum about it. The data breach resulted in multiple investigations and more than 240 lawsuits filed against the company.

#### Our take

Equifax <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/healthcare/privacy/2018/01/12/opioids-equifax.html" target="_blank">received the most number of consumer complaints</a> filed with the CFPB in 49 states in 2017. The least that the CFPB can do is get to the heart of the complaints. If it doesn't take action, it sends a strong signal that companies can get away with irresponsible behavior.

### Fed pulls brakes on Wells Fargo growth

The Federal Reserve has told Wells Fargo not to grow its assets until it has fixed its internal controls and compliance. The Fed capped Wells Fargo's asset growth to the level at which the bank's assets stood as of the end of 2017, or approximately $2 trillion. The Fed also required the San Fransisco-based bank to replace three of its 16 board members by April and a fourth board member by the end of 2018.

In a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/enforcement20180202a.htm" target="_blank">statement</a>, Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen said, "We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again. The enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers."

#### Why does this matter?

The Fed's restriction on asset growth and intervention in corporate governance are rare and have only been made under extreme circumstances. The last time the Fed was deep into the affairs of banks was when most of them were under a government bailout plan 10 years ago. This directive indicates that even for the Fed's standards, Wells Fargo's breaches were over the top. In the last two years, Wells Fargo has been found to have systematically opened fake accounts to boost sales, and misleading customers and regulators. And the fallout with state regulators and customers has not been pretty. The bank has faced multiple penalties and lawsuits since these accounts were discovered.

#### Our take

Wells Fargo has been forced to take the bitter pill, which hurts the company today but will be good for the bank in the long run. This year at least, the bank won't be able to compete with its peers because it cannot aggressively expand and take on new business. But stronger compliance systems and better board oversight means that the bank will be forced to do business in a more ethical manner and grow sustainably. And what's good for the bank is ultimately good for its customers and shareholders.
