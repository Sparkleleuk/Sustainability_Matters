**CLIMATE**

### So close yet so far

We fell off the wagon in meeting climate goals. According to a consortium of three environmental think-tanks, countries that signed on to the [Paris Agreement](http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php) are still far from meeting the goals that they pledged in 2015. The [Climate Action Tracker](http://climateactiontracker.org/) noted that in particular, the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Chile, Ukraine and Turkey are “critically insufficient” in meeting their climate goals. Note that US President Donald J. Trump is also planning to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Meanwhile, other large economies such as China, Japan, Canada and South Korea were found to be “highly insufficient”.

Wanna geek out on the country ratings? Check out the [tracker](http://climateactiontracker.org/countries.html), it is actually quite cool.

#### Why does this matter?

In 2015, all countries pledged to reduce carbon emissions to slow down the effects of global warming to 1.5C above the average temperature in the pre-industrial age (roughly before 1880). But without state action, global temperatures are expected to be 4.1C to 4.8C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century. This means the earth will be way warmer by 2100.

You might think 2100 is a long ways off, and it is. Most of us will never see the year 2100, but it does not mean we should not worry about it. Global warming is not a light bulb that is switched on when the clock strikes January 1, 2100. Global warming has, in fact, started to alter weather patterns in the form of more frequent strong storms, heat waves, and droughts, to name a few. The Arctic sea ice is also melting at [record speed](https://phys.org/news/2017-09-arctic-sea-ice-considerable.html), leading to rising sea levels. As it is, the earth is already warmer than it was 50 years ago. In fact, [2016 was already the warmest year](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201613) on record.

#### Why does this matter to you?

Depending on where you live, you will feel the impacts of global warming in different ways. If you live near the water, the views might be picture perfect from your kitchen window, but it will come with a hefty price tag. Rising sea levels is likely to raise flood insurance costs as already [proposed in Florida](http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article161486728.html). If you live inland, you may be at risk from [wild fires](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/09/why-is-2017-so-bad-for-wildfires-climate-change/539130/), which are triggered by extreme heat. Droughts will put more pressure on water resources and are likely to further [raise utility rates](http://www.circleofblue.org/2017/water-management/pricing/price-water-2017-four-percent-increase-30-large-u-s-cities/) (although the good news is [household water use in America has declined](http://www.circleofblue.org/2017/world/u-s-household-water-use-continues-decline/)). It will also increase the cost of growing food and manufacturing of stuff we use everyday, making shopping a more expensive activity. And finally, the warmer the weather, the more we spend on air-conditioning.

#### Our take

The higher the temperatures, the more $$$ we spend. This is a no-win situation.

**ETHICS**

### Tax us not

A global consortium of journalists have revealed that the world’s richest families and corporations continue to be siphoning money to tax havens to avoid paying taxes at home. The [Paradise Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/) investigation revealed that companies like Apple, Nike, and Uber as well as ultra-wealthy individuals have been using offshore accounts to avoid getting taxed in the US.

#### Why does this matter?

Tax avoidance deprives countries - even rich ones - of revenues that are used to fund welfare programs, infrastructure projects, and other things that citizens are entitled to. If companies do not pay their share of taxes, then governments cannot afford to pay for public services that we all use and for social services that benefit lower and middle-income families, We all use government services and public infrastructure. Even the company executives and ultra-rich individuals need roads and bridges to drive their cars on, cops and firemen to respond to emergencies. But all these cost money and if companies don’t pay taxes, we pay the price through reduced budgets for things we all need and (gulp) higher personal taxes. Listen, we all love our iphones but if we spend $1,000 for one, we’d rather see some of that money benefit us.

**LABOR...**

### “Climate Leave” is a thing

That’s right. Fog Creek Software, a New York City-based company that builds tools for programmers, is offering [five days of paid leave for employees impacted by weather disruptions](https://medium.com/make-better-software/climate-leave-paid-time-off-for-extreme-weather-disruptions-c5691fd346c3). The company learned its lesson from Hurricane Sandy that hit New York in 2012 when it had to manually support its operations through a city-wide blackout. Moreover, some of its employees were forced to evacuate their homes and the company had no policy to support them.

#### Do we need this?

We probably do. Extreme weather appears to be the new norm and certainly beyond anybody’s control, much like illness for which most salaried employees get paid days off. So why not have a corporate policy for it indeed? This year alone, we saw five successive hurricanes hit the continental US and territories. If the trend of extreme weather changes continues, we are likely to see more of weather disruptions over the course of our working lives. It would be a relief not to worry about being absent from work and not getting paid through these upheavals.
