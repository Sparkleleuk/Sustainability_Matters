### Controversial East Coast pipeline approved

A federal agency has approved a proposed natural gas pipeline that would carry shale gas from Pennsylvania to New Jersey. The $1.2 billion PennEast Pipeline will be 120 miles long and its owners said they will begin construction after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/penneast-pipeline-ferc-2527732964.html" target="_blank">granted the certificate of public convenience</a> last week.

#### This is controversial

The pipeline is opposed by civil society groups and environmental advocates for potential negative impacts on the water supply and the environment. Even New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy <a href="https://thecostofthepipeline.com/2017/02/04/phil-murphy-i-am-against-it-in-any-incarnation/" target="_blank">spoke against the pipeline</a> in his campaign last year. Activists say the pipeline is not a done deal and that it still faces legal hurdles in New Jersey.

#### What's the angle?

Pipelines are increasingly unwelcome in the US due to possible negative impacts on the environment. In November last year for example, a pipeline operated by TransCanada <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/11/17/pipeline.html" target="_blank">leaked 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of oil</a> in South Dakota. Another TransCanada pipeline, the Keystone XL is opposed not only for potential environmental damage but for infringing on rights of Native Americans.

### McDonald's goes sustainable

McDonald's has <a href="http://news.mcdonalds.com/Corporate/manual-releases/By-2025-all-of-McDonald-s-Packaging-to-Come-from-R" target="_blank">announced<a/> that it will use 100% sustainable packaging starting 2025. The fast food giant said that in eight years, all its packaging will come from renewable, recycled, or certified sources, preferably the Forest Stewardship Council certification. The company also said it has set a goal to recycle packaging in 100% of its restaurants.

#### Why does this matter?

McDonald's is everywhere, which means its environmental footprint is significant, and most of it from food packaging. McDonald’s said it started to transition to sustainable packaging 25 years ago, leading to a reduction in waste by 30%. At the moment, just 50% of its packaging come from sustainable sources. Going 100% in just eight years is a big leap, but if the company pulls this off, this will certainly be a whole new way to love McDonald’s.
