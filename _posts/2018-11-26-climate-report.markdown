### Trump says he doesn't believe his government's climate report

President Trump today said he has read the interagency climate report released last week, but when asked about the dire warning that unchecked global warming will have significant economic impact on the US, Trump said, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46351940" target="_blank">"I don't believe it"</a>.

#### What did the climate report say in the first place?

The <a href="https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/" target="_blank">Fourth National Climate Assessment</a> released on November 23 (Black Friday for us ordinary folks) warned that unmitigated global warming will have negative consequences for every aspect of American society and the economy. This warning is particularly dire:

"The continued warming that is projected to occur without substantial and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy throughout this century, especially in the absence of increased adaptation efforts. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the centuryâ€”more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states."

The climate report is required by law every four years and is issued by 13 federal agencies and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. Media reports say this report was more blunt and direct about the ill effects of global warming than previous reports.

#### And Trump's reaction was...

To release it on a slow news day, when most of the country is on a long Thanksgiving weekend. Today, he said he has read "some" parts of the report and said "it's fine." He did say he wants clean air and clean water too.

#### Why is this important?

Trump has been skeptical of climate change and global warming. His administration has systematically rolled back environmental regulations set in place by the Obama administration. His policies have been decidedly friendly towards the extractives industry, for example, allowing oil and gas exploration near a a wildlife refuge in Alaska, and mining in protected lands in Utah. His statement that he does not believe the economic consequences of unmitigated global warming indicates that unlike previous presidents, he is unlikely to be influenced by this report in policy-making. Not a big surprise but enough to make you go UGGGHHH.
