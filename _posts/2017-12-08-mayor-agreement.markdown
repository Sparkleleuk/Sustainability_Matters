**CLIMATE**

### Mayors defy Trump on climate

Mayors from 50 US cities signed this week a [formal agreement](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/06/568930626/50-mayors-sign-pact-to-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their cities and align their commitments to the Paris climate agreement. The agreement also outlines specific plans by city governments to meet carbon emission reduction targets by 2025.

[Highlights](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/04/chicago-climate-charter-explained-what-cities-say-theyll-do-reduce-greenhouse-gases/919372001/) of the agreement include:

* Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by an aggregate of at least 26% to 28% below the 2005 level by 2025;

* Monitoring and public reporting by each city on the progress of individual commitments;

* Inclusive climate policy development; and

* “Just transition” for those impacted by changing climate policies.

#### What does this mean?

One of President’s Trump’s first controversial pronouncements in office was of his plan to take the US off the Paris Agreement. Republicans were generally supportive while Democrats were upset. But the agreement signed this week was signed by Republican and Democrat mayors, hence the defiance is bipartisan. The mayors agreed to meet the commitment made by the US under President Obama in Paris in 2015. The agreement complements an [alliance of US states](https://www.usclimatealliance.org/) to continue pursuing the US commitment in Paris.

#### Why does this matter?

States and cities have significant influence over climate action as many environmental regulations are set at state level. State-level regulations can even exceed federal regulations. An example would be California, which has more stringent environmental standards than the US federal government. So even if Trump announces a withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, many of us will continue to see environmental regulations and initiatives. Love them or hate them, our cities are going to get more bike lanes.

**CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE UPDATE**

### Still burning

Since a wildfire broke out in Ventura County early this week, more fires have erupted in southern California. Fires broke out in San Diego, Riverside, and Los Angeles suburbs. As of Friday morning, there were six wildfires in the state.

The fire in Ventura continues to have the biggest damage, with 132,000 acres burned and 50,000 people evacuated as of this morning. The wildfires are being intensified by the [Santa Ana winds](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/weather/santa-ana-winds-explained/index.html) from inland desert regions that pass through the Santa Ana canyons in the late fall and winter. These winds are strong and hot, and can fan fires that are difficult to contain.

#### Our take

[Warming temperatures](http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/climate/2017/12/05/wildfires.html) have made forests drier and thus, susceptible to fires. The California wildfires show us yet once again that its high time to take climate change more seriously.
