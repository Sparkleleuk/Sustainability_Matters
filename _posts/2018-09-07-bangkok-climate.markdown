### Bangkok Climate Conference frustrates environmental advocates  

The first of a series of climate conferences kicked off this week but media reports indicate that the Bangkok negotiations have frustrated climate advocates.

#### What went down in Bangkok?

The international charity, ActionAid International, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/us-climate-change-paris-agreement-emissions-targets-global-warming-latest-a8527351.html" target="_blank">accused</a> the US and a few other countries of "roadblocking" negotiations on the financing of climate. The US, Japan and Australia proposed to remove specific rules for how countries should account for climate finance contributions. Developed countries had pledged to contribute a combined $100 billion a year by 2020.

#### What else?

Fiji's Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, whose island-nation is one of the most at risk countries from climate change, said governments <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-accord/governments-not-ready-for-poland-climate-change-talks-fiji-pm-idUSKCN1LK0AH" target="_blank">"are not ready"</a> for Poland. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also said that governments are "not on track" to meet a goal of the Paris agreement of capping temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the end of the century.

#### Why does Bangkok matter?

Because Bangkok is one of the key meetings to prepare for the critical climate summit in Poland in December. Governments are expected to present by the end of the year their concrete plans on how to meet the 2-degree-celsius target. But this year's negotiations, starting with the climate talks in Bonn in May, have been lackluster as developed countries like the US appeared to pull back from Paris commitments. President Trump is even pulling the US out of the climate convention. TBD on what governments will come up at the end of the Bangkok sessions. But what happens in Bangkok is definitely not staying in Bangkok.
