### Telecoms giants reportedly under investigation over eSIM

The New York Times reported that the Department of Justice is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/technology/att-verizon-investigate-esim.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness&action=click&contentCollection=business&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">investigating</a> telecommunications giants Verizon and AT&T, as well as the GSMA, a standard-setting group, for potential anti-trust violations. The Times reported the three parties are being investigated on allegations that they colluded to undermine eSIM, a technology that allows people to easily switch carriers.

#### ELI5: What is anti-trust?

An anti-trust investigation is an investigation into a business activity that inhibits competition. Such an activity typically involves at least two parties, which would allow them to maintain dominance in a market. Price-fixing is one of the most common forms of an anti-trust violation.

#### And what is eSIM?

Introduced in 2016, eSIM technology is embedded in mobile phones so that subscribers no longer have to use SIM cards. It would allow subscribers to remotely switch carriers without having to buy a new SIM card. The technology is embedded in selected Apple, Google and Microsoft devices. Verizon and AT&T are being probed for trying to influence mobile technology to maintain dominance in the market. The use of eSIM technology may lead to lower subscriptions for these companies because subscribers can easily switch providers.

#### Why does this matter?

Verizon and AT&T are the dominant wireless carriers in the US, controlling approximately 70% of the wireless market. If the allegations are proven true, this violation affects consumers because their choice of carriers and ability to switch have effectively been curtailed. But anti-trust investigations can take time, so stay tuned.

### Wells Fargo coughs up $1B

Regulators today <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/20/news/companies/wells-fargo-regulators-auto-lending-fine/index.html" target="_blank">fined Wells Fargo $1 billion</a> for charging clients for car insurance and mortgage fees that they did not need or had consented to. The fine was imposed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

#### Remind us

Wells Fargo had admitted to charging 570,000 customers for car insurance that they did not need. The bank found in an internal review that approximately 20,000 of these customers may have defaulted on their car loans and their vehicles repossessed. The bank also admitted that it charged mortgage borrowers late fees for missing a deadline to lock in promised interest rates, although the delays were the bank's fault. These are in addition to a number of wrongdoings the bank has been linked to in the last two years. Remember the fake accounts their sales staff created? The bank got fined and sued for that too.

#### Why does this matter?

A $1 billion fine is material even for a bank the size of Wells Fargo. The bank is likely going to take a short-term hit to pay regulators. The size of the fine itself is significant, it signals that the government is serious about penalizing the company. The Federal Reserve, which regulates the banking industry, has already <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/ethics/finance/privacy/2018/02/06/equifax-wfc.html" target="_blank">stepped in</a> and directed the company to change some members of its board, as well as restrict its asset growth until it has put its house in order. If all these do not prevent Wells Fargo from shaping up, nothing else will.
