### Private security group planned to mine rare earth minerals in Afghanistan

The founder of the infamous Blackwater private security group offered his services to the Trump administration in Afghanistan, with a plan to secure and extract rare earth minerals. Buzzfeed [published](https://www.buzzfeed.com/aramroston/private-war-erik-prince-has-his-eye-on-afghanistans-rare?utm_term=.hm4MDJVZjo#.ysKApgkzZ8) the [presentation](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4322811-The-Prince-Pitch.html) by Erik Prince, which he had reportedly used to pitch his services to administration officials in DC. The slide deck outlined a plan not just for the exit of US military personnel from Afghanistan but also to mine rare earth minerals, which are used for various industrial products including batteries of electric cars and components of smartphones, among other products. The presentation noted that Helmand province alone has two types of "extremely" high grade rare earth elements.

#### Remind me again of Blackwater

Blackwater was founded in 1997 by Prince and won a US military contract to support US combat troops in Iraq. Blackwater got into trouble when its soldiers killed 14 civilians in Baghdad, raising concerns about the involvement of private security groups in combat zones. Blackwater underwent a series of corporate transformations and was later acquired by bigger private security contractors.

#### And what about Erik Prince?

Prince went on to form another private security firm, [Frontier Services Group](http://www.fsgroup.com/en/index.html) that is headquartered in Beijing and listed in Hong Kong. A former Navy SEAL, Prince is a very wealthy man from a very wealthy family, who was criticized for [financing](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-man-behind-proposition-8) the campaign against California's Proposition 8 banning same-sex marriage in 2008.

#### But the issue here is...

Rare earth minerals, which are in high demand. But the worldwide supply is declining. China controls the bulk of the remaining supply, which makes the US uncomfortable. Mining and processing rare earth minerals have severe damage to the environment in that the processing alone releases tons of wastewater and other forms of waste. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rare-earth-mining-china-social-environmental-costs) reported that processing one ton of rare earths produces 2,000 tons of toxic waste. In fact, Chinese communities near mines have had to be relocated due to contamination from mine leaks. If rare earth is mined and processed in Afghanistan, which has even lower environmental safeguards than in China, the impacts would be even more immense.

#### Our take

While we love our smartphones to bits, the scale of the environmental damage caused by rare earth mining is disturbing. And so is Prince's proposal.
