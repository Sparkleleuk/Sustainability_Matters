### Global banks to integrate climate risks in lending

At least 16 global banks have developed <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/16-banks-and-united-nations-produce-first-guidance-help-banking" target="_blank">new guidance</a> on how to integrate climate change scenarios in their lending activities. The guidance not only allows financial institutes to enhance their risk management procedures, but also allows them to seize opportunities under different climate scenarios.

#### ELI5

Banks’ primary role is to finance economic activity, right? But they don’t just finance business without assessing credit risk, or the risk that the loan will not be repaid. Banks typically consider a number of financial and non-financial factors when assessing credit risk and this guidance helps them integrate climate risks in their credit risk assessment. For example, a bank that is preparing to loan money to an energy company would now look into how the energy company is preparing for risks associated with extreme weather or changes in carbon-related regulations. Based on this and other factors, the bank may raise the interest rate on the loan or may deny the loan altogether.

#### But what about opportunities?

Climate change may sound like the end of the world as we know it, but it’s not all bad news. There are opportunities to be tapped in the area of climate risk mitigation. Electric cars, for example, are an opportunity that has exploded in the last two years. The new guidance, thus, helps banks identify opportunities as they emerge and helps them direct capital to economic activities that combat climate change while providing decent returns at the same time.

#### Why does this matter?

This guidance sounds academic, we know, and WTFC, right? But this matters because it gives banks the tool to seriously integrate climate issues into their main area of business. For many years, banks have been saying that they find it hard to meaningfully integrate climate risks in their credit risk models because, well, climate issues are about things that may happen in 50 years, and banks typically look at credit risks over just a couple of years. But with this guidance, there is no more excuse not to consider climate risks. They just gotta do it.

#### P.S. And the banks are…

ANZ, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Bradesco, Citi, DNB, Itaú Unibanco, National Australia Bank, Rabobank, Royal Bank of Canada, Santander, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, TD Bank Group and UBS. Clap clap.
