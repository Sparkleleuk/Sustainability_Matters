### Women workers in Ford plants claim sexual harassment

The [New York Times reported](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/ford-chicago-sexual-harassment.html?_r=0) this week that women workers in Ford Motor Company’s manufacturing plants in Chicago have been subjected to sexual harassment by co-workers and supervisors. The Times reported that these practices have gone on for 25 years despite previous lawsuits against the company, and despite Ford’s policies against discrimination and boorish behavior. [Ford CEO Jim Hackett apologized](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/us/ford-apology-sexual-harassment.html) to workers and promised that the company “will learn from this” and that it “will do better”.

#### WhatAboutUs

The report sheds light on a culture of harassment in blue-collared work environments, where victims have limited resources to defend themselves. The #MeToo movement has been driven primarily by high-profile and mostly wealthy women, but there have been limited insights into male-dominated workplaces, where women may be more reluctant to share their experiences for fear of losing their jobs.

#### The aftermath

After the New York Times report was released, one of the women workers was [retaliated against](https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/nyts-jodi-kantor-on-misconduct-allegations-at-ford-work-was-used-as-leverage/). Her supervisor cut her hours. How f’d up is that?

### Apple did what?

Apple admitted that it intentionally slowed down older phones so that the batteries can still handle increased processing power required by newer apps. Apple is now facing at least three proposed class action lawsuits. [One lawsuit](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/22/apple-lawsuits-intentional-slowing-older-iphones) claimed that this was intended to force customers to buy new phones. Another lawsuit is seeking compensation for economic damages. The [third lawsuit](http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/12/22/third-iphone-battery-lawsuit-says-apple-used-slowdowns-to-avoid-fixing-defects) alleged that Apple tried to avoid the full cost of fixing defects.

#### Why does this matter?

The issue is about Apple’s concealment of this intentional slowing down of the phones. As one lawsuit noted, when a product costs that much, customers expect a high level of performance from it. The company may end up having to recall batteries to make customers happy. A first world problem, but these phones are expensive even for first world standards. Customers deserve better.
