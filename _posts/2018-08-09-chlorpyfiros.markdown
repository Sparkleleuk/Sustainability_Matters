### Court rules against EPA in chlorpyrifos case

A US federal court <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/09/politics/epa-court-order-ban-pesticide-chlorpyrifos/index.html" target="_blank">ordered</a> on August 9 the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ban a widely-used pesticide that is feared to have harmful effects on human health. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals directed the EPA "revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for chlorypyrifos within 60 days". The EPA said it is reviewing the decision.

#### What is chlorpyrifos?

It is a pesticide that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/politics/chlorpyrifos-pesticide-ban-epa-court.html" target="_blank">reportedly</a> used in more than 50 fruit, nut, cereal and vegetable crops. Apples, almonds, oranges and broccoli are among the produce that may have been treated with chlorpyrifos. In 2016 alone, more than 640,000 acres in California were treated with this product. Dow Chemical (now DowDuPont) is the leading manufacturer of chlorpyrifos.

#### What are people concerned about?

Academic studies have linked chlorpyrifos to delays in brain development of children exposed to this chemical. One such study was by <a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/pesticide-chlorpyrifos-linked-childhood-developmental-delays" target="_blank">Columbia University</a> in 2010, which reinforced the link between the product and early childhood development delays. Chlorpyrifos was banned for household use in the US in 2000 but is still widely used in agriculture. Public health advocates have sought for a total ban on the chemical for the last 10 years.

#### Why does this matter?

Because this represents a victory for public health and safety, especially that the EPA is about to formally allow new use of asbestos, another health hazard, by the manufacturing industry. You win some, then lose some.

<i>This place will burn</i>. ~ Email sent by Forrest Gordon Clark to a local volunteer fire chief in Orange County, California. Clark was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45119331" target="_blank">arrested</a> by police on suspicion of having started one of 18 wildfires raging across Northern California. Wildfires are caused by either natural disasters (such as lightning strikes) or human activity (such as arson) and often fueled by the high winds.
