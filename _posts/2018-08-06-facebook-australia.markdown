### Facebook offers Messenger to improve banks' customer service

Facebook today <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-banks/facebook-in-talks-with-banks-to-expand-customer-service-idUSKBN1KR1KY" target="_blank">said it is in talks</a> with some of the largest US financial services companies to explore the possibility of using Messenger for banks' customer service. Facebook said Messenger can be used by customers of PayPal, Citibank, and American Express to speak with a customer service representative instead of waiting on the line for a bank representative.

#### The intention is good, but...

To use Messenger for customer service, customers would need to link their financial accounts to the Messenger service. Sounds creepy, we know. But note that Facebook already offers e-commerce transactions through Marketplace, and Messenger itself already offers money transfer between friends. So it's not exactly newbie in finance, although its services are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-06/facebook-shares-rise-on-optimism-for-banking-relationships" target="_blank">not as highly ranked</a> as other services by Consumer Reports.

#### What say Facebook?

A company spokesperson said Facebook could see some financial information if users opt-in, but Facebook is not using the information for marketing. “We’re not using this information beyond enabling these (customer service) types of experiences. A critical part of these partnerships is keeping people’s information safe and secure,” Facebook said.

#### Why does this matter?

Because data privacy? The company has faced severed allegations of failing to protect user data, resulting in reduced active usage among Facebook users in the last quarter. While Messenger may offer a good technological solution to customer service woes, we're not sure if this is the time to be linking sensitive financial information to the company. Using your credit card to donate to charity or to buy a an old couch in Marketplace is one thing, but having your checking account information at Facebook's disposal is another. Or maybe we're just paranoid.

### Aussie government extends aid to farmers

It may be winter in the southern hemisphere but that Australia is experiencing one of its worst droughts, prompting the government to expand its financial assistance to farmers. The Australian government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-drought-assistance/australia-announces-extra-140-million-aid-package-for-drought-hit-farmers-idUSKBN1KQ03C" target="_blank">announced an aid package</a> worth A$190 million ($140.56 million), bringing the federal government's total aid package A$576 million.

#### Which area is most affected?

New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, is the most affected with 99% of the state in drought. The state government of New South Wales has provided more than A$1 billion in assistance for farmers. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/" target="_blank">reported</a> that July 2018 was the driest since 2002, and rainfall was the lowest on record.

#### Why does this matter?

Australia's spending reflects the increased pressure of extreme weather conditions on national and local budgets. Governments in Western Europe and North America are also spending more to provide drought relief to the agriculture sector, while battling environmental disasters like wildfires and red tide.

**ICYMI**

#### **Indonesia experiences second strong quake**

A magnitude <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-06/indonesia-issues-tsunami-warning-after-quake-off-lombok/10076088" target="_blank">6.9 earthquake</a> struck Indonesia's Lombok island on August 5, resulting in the death of at least 98 people.

#### **Baby blue whale washes ashore in Japanese beach**

A dead <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20180806_26/" target="_blank">blue whale washed ashore</a> in Yuigahama Beach in Kamakura City, about 40 miles from Tokyo on August 5.
