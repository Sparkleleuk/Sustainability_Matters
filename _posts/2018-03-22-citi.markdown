### Citi puts its foot down

Citigroup today directed its staff to impose restrictions on gun sales by customers, the first major bank to do so. The company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-22/citigroup-restricts-some-gun-sales-by-its-business-customers" target="_blank">released a memo</a> saying that it will prohibit retailers from offering bump stocks or selling guns to people who have not passed a background check or are younger than 21 years old. CEO Mike Corbat said, “The policy was designed to respect the rights of responsible gun owners while helping to keep firearms out of the wrong hands. It is clear to me that most people believe there are areas of agreement and practical changes we can make to find common ground.”

#### Why does this matter?

Because mass shootings continue to occur but the government continues to be too slow to respond. More companies took a stand following the February 14 Parkland, Florida shooting, by cutting ties to the National Rifle Association. Retailers such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart went a step further by <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/diversity/human%20rights/2018/02/28/google-retailers-guns.html" target="_blank">halting sales of assault rifles and raising the age limit for gun buyers</a>. Citi's move curtails access to lending for customers that do not abide by the bank's service conditions.

#### **Quote of the day: Not everything green is clean**

<em>I consider the building of the airport to be corruption. And those defending the building of the airport in Lake Texcoco are involved in the business of corruption.</em> ~ Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the front-runner in Mexico's presidential elections. The construction of the new airport is partly funded by a <a href="https://www.paulhastings.com/news/details/?id=e529ed69-2334-6428-811c-ff00004cbded" target="_blank">$4 billion green bond issuance</a>. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-election-airport/mexico-presidential-front-runner-plans-steps-to-halt-corrupt-new-airport-idUSKBN1GY3E9?il=0" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
