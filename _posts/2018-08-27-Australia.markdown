### Australian Prime Minister ousted over energy policy

Conservative members of the Australian parliament <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2018/08/24/australian-prime-minister-ousted-dispute-over-energy-policy/OMN4G72ee7KvkHCCqjZRHJ/story.html" target="_blank">ousted former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnball</a> on August 24, following disagreement over Turnball’s plan to set targets for carbon emissions reduction. Turnball was replaced by Scott Morrison, Australia’s treasurer who was also behind its tough policy on refugees and asylum seekers.

#### The trigger

Turnball was pushing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/world/australia/turnbull-energy-emissions-climate-change.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Faustralia&action=click&contentCollection=australia&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=5&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">to enshrine into law</a> a plan to reduce energy emissions level to 26% by 2030, which matched Australia’s climate commitment in Paris in 2015. But the plan was unpopular among conservative members of the Liberal Party, and this is no surprise. Australia is an exporter of coal and the economy is reliant on the energy industry. This was the third energy policy put forward by Turnball. A few days before his ouster, he abandoned the proposal as tensions between him and conservative members of the party escalated. But he was ousted nonetheless.

#### Why does this matter?

It shows that energy and climate change shape politics in countries where energy is a key contributor to the country’s economy. Think Australia, Canada and the US. So you still wonder why a seemingly progressive Justin Trudeau approved the Canadian government’s acquisition of a controversial gas pipeline from Kinder Morgan? TBD how long he stays in power with this political tightrope he's walking.

#### But back to Oz

All this happened while southern Australia is experiencing one of its driest seasons ever. The Australian government earlier this month announced an aid package worth A$190 million ($140.56 million) to farmers affected by the drought, bringing the federal government’s total aid package A$576 million. Mitigating climate change has never been as important as it is now, don't you think?
