### California requires public companies to have at least one woman in the board

California becomes the first US state to require at least one woman in the board of public companies headquartered in California. The new requirement is an effort to promote gender diversity in corporate America.

#### What's the requirement?

The new law signed by Governor Jerry Brown on September 30, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653318005/california-becomes-1st-state-to-require-women-on-corporate-boards" target="_blank">requires</a> at least one woman on boards that have four members or less, two women on boards of five people, and three women on boards of six or more. The required number of women directors must be fully installed by 2021. The new requirement will <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nearly-100-california-companies-have-no-women-on-board-of-directors/" target="_blank">affect</a> more than 100 publicly listed companies headquarters in California, which do not have a single woman in their boards. Among such companies are Skechers USA, TiVo Corporation (yep, the one that records missed TV episodes), and WageWorks (which handles pre-tax benefits).

#### But as expected...

Businesses are complaining. The California Chamber of Commerce said in an <a href="http://blob.capitoltrack.com/17blobs/713497c1-4d2f-4865-acb1-6492b4a2ad1c" target="_blank">open letter</a> that the legislation is potentially unconstitutional because it prioritizes gender over other aspects of diversity. The chamber noted that it may displace qualified board members "simply on the basis of gender".

#### Supporters are saying...

“We are tired of being nice. We’re tired of being polite. We are going to require this because it’s going to benefit the economy. It’s going to benefit each of these companies. It’s time that we burst that man-cave and put women in the boardrooms,” said Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) in a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-may-2018-california-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-1535656445-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">speech</a> last week.

#### Why does this matter?

Because, diversity. Diversity in boardrooms and corporate management is acknowledged to have positive effects on decision-making. California's legislation is a bold step and resembles Norway, which required in 2007 that women make up 40% of the board of Norwegian companies. This sets a precedent for other states with heavy corporate presence, but TBD if these states will follow suit given the legal opposition that California's businesses may mount against the law.

**ICYMI**

#### **Tsunami in Indonesia claims more than 1,000 lives**

The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/01/653268266/indonesian-tsunami-death-toll-hits-1-200-survivors-desperate-for-aid" target="_blank">death toll</a> from a tsunami that hit the Central Sulawesi province of Indonesia over the weekend has increased to more than 1,200, making it one of the deadliest in the country in 12 years. The 18-foot tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake. The area is also affected by food and water shortages. A massive tsunami that hit Aceh province and parts of eastern Indonesia in December 2004 killed nearly 250,000 people, and was the deadliest tsunami in history. 


#### **Elon gets the boot as Tesla chair**

Tesla and its founder, Elon Musk, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/29/sec-settles-charges-with-teslas-elon-musk-will-remain-as-ceo.html" target="_blank">agreed</a> to pay $20 million each to settle a fraud lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Musk also agreed to step down as Tesla chair. The combination of Twitter and fast fingers has never been a good thing.
