### World's oldest insurance market won't invest in coal anymore

Lloyd's of London has announced it will no longer invest in coal. The world's oldest insurance market joins a number of asset managers and owners in the United Kingdom, which have excluded coal companies in its investment decisions. Lloyd's is not an insurance company and does not underwrite insurance policies. Inga Beale, Lloyd’s of London chief executive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/lloyds-of-london-to-divest-from-coal-over-climate-change" target="_blank">told The Guardian</a>, that the decision means "that in the areas of our portfolio where we can directly influence investment decisions we will avoid investing in companies that are involved mainly in coal.” The strategy takes effect on April 1st.

#### It's not an April Fool's joke

Lloyd's of London is actually a Johnny come lately. A number of asset owners and managers, such as Generali, Swiss Re, Zurich, Storebrand and the Church of England, have already excluded coal in their investment portfolios as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/dec/07/climate-change-threatens-ability-insurers-manage-risk" target="_blank">uninsured losses from extreme weather events continue to rise</a>. Banks have also stopped providing loans to companies that generate majority of revenues from coal. Some financial firms have gone the extra mile by also excluding oil companies from their investments. The business case for dirty fuel has become much smaller than it used to.

#### Why does this matter?

The capital markets are an important source of capital for companies. But with asset owners closing their doors to coal companies, capital for coal extraction is going to become even more scarce. Coal is the dirtiest source of energy and restricted access to capital ultimately reduces the amount of coal in the market, which helps the environment.

#### Our take

Coal production and consumption have generally seen <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/csr/ethics/2018/01/10/coal-ford-oil.html" target="_blank">a slow but steady decline</a> and Lloyd's decision is just one more signal that the reign of coal is long over.

### Montana goes rogue on net neutrality

The state of Montana has defied the federal government. In <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-montana/montana-governor-takes-stand-for-state-to-honor-net-neutrality-idUSKBN1FB30O" target="_blank">an executive order</a> signed today, Governor Steve Bullock required state contractors to continue to honor net neutrality rules despite the repeal of the rules by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). "Montana's future depends on a free and open internet. Today we became the first state in the nation to actually do something to safeguard internet freedom," Bullock <a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorBullock/status/955509055526617089" target="_blank">tweeted</a>.

#### What's happened again?

The Republican-controlled FCC repealed net neutrality rules in December 2017 despite significant opposition from a number of states, including New York, where the FCC is based. New York State claimed that the FCC's decision was possibly based on approximately 2 million fake comments made on behalf of unsuspecting US residents whose identities were stolen. But the FCC went ahead to repeal the rules anyway, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/technology/montana-net-neutrality.html" target="_blank">prohibited states from creating net neutrality rules</a>.

#### Why does this matter?

Montana's decision to override the FCC sets a precedent for other states that had been stewing over the FCC's decision. At least 22 state attorneys have sued the FCC over the repeal. However, Montana could face a long legal battle over its executive order, including possible lawsuits by internet providers who are the primary beneficiaries of the repeal.

#### Our take

Internet providers will not have it easy despite the FCC's favorable decision. The repeal is hotly contested and infringes on basic human rights, which means that the battle over this issue will be long and arduous. In the meantime, internet providers face customer backlash should they start prioritizing certain content or charging more for premium content. They had their birthday in December, but they can't eat their cake until who knows when.
