### There will be blood

This week, the US Congress approved two bills that allow precious metal mining and oil drilling in two protected areas. The [Senate tax bill](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/overnights/362214-overnight-energy-anwr-drilling-moves-toward-senate-floor), which was passed by the Senate Committee on Budget last Tuesday, includes a provision to allow oil drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The bill has moved to the Senate floor for deliberation and only needs 51 votes to pass in the Senate. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives [approved](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/362613-house-votes-to-overturn-obama-mining-ban-in-minnesota) the Minnesota’s Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest (MINER) Act, which allows the resumption of sulfur ore mining in the Lake Superior forest area. In voting for both bills, Republicans said these activities will help the economies of Alaska and Minnesota, while Democrats who opposed the measures fear the negative impact on the environment and biodiversity.

#### Why do these bills matter?

The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge is the country’s largest wildlife refuge and lies on the Arctic Ocean. Allowing oil exploration poses an exceptionally high risk of contamination and pollution in an area rich in biodiversity because of the complexity of oil drilling, much less drilling in harsh Arctic  conditions.  Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski from Alaska has been trying to get Congress to enact an oil drilling bill for years, but has been largely unsuccessful until this year under a Republican-dominated Congress. Props for the creativity: she managed to sneak an oil drilling provision in a tax bill. What's the connection again?

The bill on Minnesota poses similar environmental threats to the waterways in the Lake Superior region. Mines release toxic wastes that [pollute](http://www.pollutionissues.com/Li-Na/Mining.html) land, air and water resources for generations. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Tom Emmer of the 6th district of Minnesota. He represents the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities, as well as St. Cloud, areas that will, conveniently, not be mined.  

The silver lining to these congressional debates is the House has [passed](http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/362664-house-passes-epa-contaminated-site-clean-up-bill) a bill reauthorizing a contaminated site clean-up program - the brownsfield program - by the Environmental Protection Agency. The House approved a $200 million annual budget for the program, shared by all 51 states and Native American Tribes, which amounts to $50 million per state a year.

#### Our take

If you live in Alaska and Minnesota, these measures should concern you. If you live elsewhere, they still matter because everything in connected, what gets dumped somewhere eventually ends up in our backyards. Or in our [food](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/oilimpacts.html). Heard about the [lobster with a Pepsi "tattoo"](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/11/lobster-claw-pepsi-soda-can-new-brunswick-spd/)? Damage to the environment by man-made waste is irreparable and irremediable. Meaning, once it’s gone, we can never have it back. Yes, the EPA can help clean leaks, but frankly, cleaning up a major contamination [costs more](http://blog.meltblowntechnologies.com/how-much-it-costs-to-clean-up-an-oil-spill) than $50 million.

### It's still a white man's world

A study by a non-profit group has found that while there have been improvements in diversity of executive leadership in Silicon Valley, ethnic minorities are still underrepresented relative to their share of the workforce in technology companies. The [Ascend Foundation](http://www.ascendleadership.org/), which promotes Asians in business, found that “race is an increasingly more significant impediment than gender to climbing the management ladder.” The group noted that Asian women were least likely to be promoted to managerial or executive positions even if they are most likely to be hired. African-Americans and Hispanics have declined in their percentage share of the professional workforce. Meanwhile, white men and women are “twice as likely as Asians to become executives and hold almost three times the number of executive jobs.”

More on the group’s findings and how it conducted the study  [here](http://www.ascendleadership.org/news/369626/www.ascendleadership.org/research).

#### Why should we care?

Diversity is [critical](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b14z9vj7fn4j6j/the-importance-of-diversity-in-the-workplace) to the longevity of a company in a more global and interconnected economy. Companies with a diverse workforce are able to make good use of the diversity of insights and experiences of its employees to adapt to change and innovate. It has been proven that a boardroom full of people who look, talk and walk alike are less likely to anticipate change, much less understand change, than a boardroom with different types of people. In other words, diverse companies are successful companies. And we all have an interest in seeing these companies succeed as a business. In all likelihood, our pensions are invested in many of the Silicon Valley heavyweights, so we want them to continue growing, making money, and changing the world.

As employees and consumers, diversity or the lack of it, strikes closer to home. If you are a normal human being and work for a company but are underrepresented in management, there is a likelihood that your interests and concerns are not taken considered in corporate policy making. As customers, being underrepresented could mean that our needs and preferences as consumers are not in the priority list of the companies whose products we support.

#### America is changing…

It is getting [browner](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/03/what-america-will-look-like-in-2050-less-christian-less-white-more-gray/?utm_term=.761227618322). It’s time for management teams to be the same as well.
