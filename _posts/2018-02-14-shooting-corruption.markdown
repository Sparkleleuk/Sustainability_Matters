### Remington plans to file for bankruptcy protection

Remington Outdoor Company Inc., America's oldest gunmaker, is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-remingtonoutdoor-bankruptcy/u-s-gunmaker-remington-reaches-deal-with-creditors-to-file-for-bankruptcy-idUSKBN1FW23Q" target="_blank">filing for bankruptcy</a> as the gun industry continues to experience a decline in gun sales. Remington is looking to reduce its $950 million debt load by seeking court approval to write off $700 million in debt. The company will receive $145 million in financing to carry it through the bankruptcy process. Remington and other gun manufacturers have experienced a decline in revenues in the last two years.

#### It's never the reason why

It's not because America suddenly hates guns and have stopped buying them. It's because Americans have stopped stockpiling firearms under a carte blanche assurance by President Trump that the gun industry would not be regulated under his presidency. So gun owners have calmed down and stopped panic buying, leading to lower sales since Trump was elected in 2016.

#### In the meantime...

A 19-year-old man <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/police-respond-shooting-parkland-florida-high-school-n848101" target="_blank">opened fire</a> in a school in Parkland, Florida, killing at least 17 people and wounding several others. It was the 18th mass shooting in the US in 2018, <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/school-shootings/5852/" target="_blank">according to the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety</a>.  

#### Our take

The decline in gun sales (we think this is temporary though) does not, ironically, signal reduced threat from gun-related crime. Instead, it signals that guns are here to stay and that gun ownership is alive and well. So there is no end in sight to gun-related tragedies.

### Norwegian fund sets sights on corruption

Norway's sovereign wealth fund is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/norway-swf/norway-wealth-fund-to-firms-fight-corruption-idUSO9N1OT003" target="_blank">calling on publicly-listed corporations</a> to reduce exposure to corruption and prevent corrupt activities from occurring. The Norwegian fund urged company boards to establish anti-corruption policies and procedures that are clearly communicated to employees. The fund also prescribed an anonymous whistleblowing mechanism with a "separate and confidential escalation route".

#### And more

The fund is also planning to actively push companies to disclose non-financial data, such as climate-related and water-related information, in the 2018 proxy season. Disclosure of such information would allow the fund to better assess its investment risks. Moreover, the fund is calling companies to appoint independent directors to their boards.

#### Why does this matter?

With approximately $1 trillion in assets, the Norwegian sovereign fund is the largest in the world and has real influence in the capital markets. It invests in more than 9,000 publicly-listed companies and has real market power to influence corporate behavior. Companies can't just turn their heads the other way when the Norwegians say something. And the Norwegians are not lone rangers in their activism. More and more large investors are pushing companies to address non-financial risks. Last year, more than 200 institutional investors <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/ethics/environment/human%20rights/2017/12/13/net-neutrality.html" target="_blank">pledged</a> to keep a close eye on heavy carbon emitters. Earlier this year, BlackRock, the world's largest investor, urged companies to have a <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/finance/csr/environment/2018/01/16/Blackrock-China.html" target="_blank">positive societal impact</a>. ICYMI sustainability is now really a thing.
