### Clean water regulations suspended

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/climate/trump-water-wotus.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fclimate&action=click&contentCollection=climate&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">started the paper work</a> to suspend the "Waters of the United States" regulation, executing one of President Trump's first executive actions when he was sworn into office. The regulation identified the rivers, streams, lakes and marshes under the protection of the federal government and was intended to limit the use of pollutants by farmers and ranchers, which could flow into small streams and waterways. The EPA is drafting a new version of the regulation.

#### The rundown

This <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/epa-waterways-wetlands-rule-118319" target="_blank">regulation</a> was passed in 2015 by President Obama and was immediately criticized by farmers and ranchers as an infringement of property rights. Its implementation was hampered by legal action, but was finally going to go into effect after a Supreme Court decision last week. Trump had also criticized the regulation when he assumed the presidency, and signed an executive order directing the EPA to rescind the rule and replace it with a less restrictive alternative.

#### Our take

The regulation was intended to protect 60% of America's bodies of water. The suspension increases risks of contamination of water systems that may feed sources of drinking water. More water filters are in our future.
