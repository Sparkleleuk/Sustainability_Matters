### EPA says fuel efficiency rules are "too stringent"

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-04/documents/mte-final-determination-notice-2018-04-02.pdf" target="_blank">formally scrapped fuel efficiency rules</a> for the automobile industry, saying the Obama-era rules are "too stringent". The agency withdrew the requirement that cars and light trucks sold in the US must average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025. The EPA says the requirement "presents challenges for auto manufacturers due to feasibility and practicability, raises potential concerns related to automobile safety, and results in significant additional costs on consumers, especially low-income consumers."

#### Why does this matter?

Because, climate change. The Obama administration supported higher fuel efficiency standards to help reduce carbon emissions from the transportation sector. As of 2015, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank">the transportation sector</a> was the second largest source of GHG emissions in the US, second only to electricity. Electricity accounted for 29% while transportation (which includes cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, and other vehicles) accounted for 27%. The Obama government set a standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, a goal that was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-fuel-efficiency-goals-could-fall-short-by-2025-federal-report-finds/2016/07/18/43660cec-4cf1-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html?utm_term=.7026d1df8bf5" target="_blank">undermined by more people buying SUVs</a>. Obvs Americans like them big.

#### Our take

The auto sector had opposed the fuel efficiency standards, saying these were too restrictive. President Trump promised the auto sector that he would roll back the rules to jumpstart the US auto industry and he did just that today. Yet, the Obama-era rules also helped hasten the development of electric cars where an arms race to develop the best and greatest have started. Reduced fuel efficiency could slow down e-car development and send more gas guzzlers down the great American highways, further raising emissions from the transportation sector. Unless of course auto companies themselves ignore any new rules and stick to their current assumptions. After all, administrations change and presidents leave office but climate change isn't going anywhere.

### Saks, Lord & Taylor hacked

Retailers Saks and Lord & Taylor confirmed that approximately <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/01/technology/saks-hack-credit-debit-card/index.html" target="_blank">5 million credit cards</a> have been compromised due to an intrusion in its point of sales machines. The breach may have affected the entire Lord & Taylor network, mostly in New York and New Jersey, and dates back to sales made in May 2017. There is no indication that the intrusion affected online sales. Pfew.

#### Why does this matter?

Because information stolen from customers were <a href="https://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-syndicate-hacks-saks-fifth-avenue-and-lord-taylor/" target="_blank">sold in the dark web</a> last week, according to cybersecurity firm Gemini Advisory. The JokerStash hacking group announced the sale on March 28 and has released 125,000 records. Gemini Advisory expects the group to release the entire cache of stolen info in the coming months.

#### Our take

What's also notable about this incident is the length of time that this hack was undiscovered. Gemini Advisory estimated that the window of compromise is between May 2017 to present, which means it took a really long time for the company to discover the theft and act on it. Being hacked is not the issue, but the failure to detect and close the vulnerability in a timely manner is.
