### SocGen and UniCredit eyeing merger

Two of Europe's largest banks, Societe General SA (SocGen) of France and UniCredit SpA of Italy, are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-03/unicredit-is-said-to-push-for-merger-with-socgen-ft-reports" target="_blank">reportedly eyeing a merger</a>. Media reports indicate that the discussions are at the very early stages and both companies refused to comment on the planned, first reported by the Financial Times.

#### Who are SocGen and UniCredit?

The Paris-headquartered <a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/InfographieGroupe2015/index-en.html" target="_blank">SocGen</a> is France's third largest bank in assets and the sixth largest in Europe. It provides various services from retail banking to investment banking and asset management. This means the bank offers the sophisticated financial services available in the market today. SocGen employs roughly 143,000 staff and operates in 76 countries. Milan-based <a href="https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en/unicredit-at-a-glance.html" target="_blank">UniCredit</a> is Italy's largest bank by assets and employs 147,000 staff. It operates in more than 20 countries. UniCredit's operations are primarily commercial banking, which means it has a more traditional business model and can probably benefit from SocGen's expertise in other forms of financial services.

#### There's a catch...

SocGen's non-commercial banking units have been the source of the French bank's woes that range from rogue trading to other forms of ethical misconduct. On June 4, SocGen agreed to pay a total of $1.3 billion in fines to settle multiple US government investigations of ethical misconduct. SocGen had been investigated for bribing Libyan officials (penalty: $585 million) and manipulating LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate (penalty: $750 million). One of its subsidiaries pled guilty to corruption charges also in relation to the Libyan bribery scandal. The settlement allows the bank to move on, but there are no guarantees that these things won't happen again.

#### Why is this planned merger important?

Because size matters. European banks have been falling behind their American cousins in terms of size of assets. What didn't kill the US banking industry made it stronger, and American banks emerged from the financial crisis larger and more competitive than ever. Size brings opportunities because bigger banks have more access to lucrative deals because of the breadth of their services. Hence, consolidation has been the talk of the banking industry in Europe.

#### Why does this matter to us?

Because size also carries risks. Remember when the biggest banks in the world nearly collapsed because of mortgage loans? Governments in the US and Europe could not afford to let them go so taxpayers had to chip in and bail the banks out. Citigroup for example <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/42099554" target="_blank">received more than $475 billion in cash and guarantees</a>, the largest federal aid granted during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Bank of America received $336 billion and Morgan Stanley received $135 billion. Over in Europe, banks like the Royal Bank of Scotland and ING Group were also under government ownership for quite sometime. Therefore, the larger the bank, the greater the likelihood that taxpayers would be on the hook when the next crisis occurs. We understand why size matters, but we are wary of it. Just learning from the tough lessons of recent history.

**BEFORE YOU GO...**

#### **Quote of the day: Miss America 2.0**

<i>To prepare great women for the world, and to prepare the world for great women.</i> ~ The new motto of Miss America. Miss America Organization CEO Gretchen Carlson announced that that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/06/05/617088219/miss-america-drops-its-swimsuit-competition-embracing-whole-new-era" target="_blank">Miss America will get rid of the swimsuit and evening gown portions</a> as part of an overhaul from being a "pageant" to a "competition". Women will no longer be judged by their looks but by their brains. Call Miss America sexist but we must admit these changes are dope. Guess we're all tuning in to Miss America in September to see if it delivers on its promise.
