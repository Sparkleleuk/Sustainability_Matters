### Tech firms still face pressure on hate speech

Legislators in the UK's House of Commons Home Affairs Committee today [questioned](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/u-k-lawmakers-slam-facebook-google-twitter-on-hate-speech) executives from technology firms such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, on content that promote hate and violence, despite their promise to remove such content from their sites. The executives testified that they were making rapid progress on removing hate speech and extremist content in their sites by hiring more staff and making use of artificial intelligence.

#### Why is this important?

There is evidence that extremists use social media platforms to [promote](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-hatred-goes-viral-inside-social-medias-efforts-to-combat-terrorism/) their ideology, [recruit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/31574846/how-islamic-state-extremists-use-social-media-to-recruit) members, or attack their critics. Recent lone wolf terrorist attacks in the US and the UK show that the perpetrators were radicalized via Facebook posts and YouTube videos. This has prompted some countries in Europe to take a stronger position. Germany's [law on hate speech](https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/02/germanys-social-media-hate-speech-law-is-now-in-effect/) in social media came into effect in October 2017 while the UK is looking to fine social media companies if they fail to remove extremist content within two hours.  

#### How are the tech giants responding?

In June, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google [formed](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/26/google-facebook-counter-terrorism-online-extremism) the Global Internet Forum and voluntarily committed to immediately remove hate speech and extremist posts. Yesterday, Twitter said it has started to [close down accounts](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/365424-twitter-to-begin-enforcing-new-hate-speech-rules) affiliated with groups “that use or promote violence against civilians to further their causes.” Facebook and YouTube (owned by Google), have similarly beefed up staff to review content and hit the delete button.

#### Our take

Silicon Valley has been slow to acknowledge that (cliche alert) with great power comes great responsibility. But faced with regulatory pressure and potential penalties, the tech giants are finally getting their act together. We say better late than never.

#### P.S. Germany vs Facebook

Facebook is facing the heat the Germany not just for hate speech content but also for gathering user's data that may further enhance its market dominance. The Federal Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-19/facebook-s-data-harvesting-under-fire-from-german-cartel-agency) that the Office is "concerned" about the way it collects and uses data from third parties, which can be an abuse of its market power. Facebook is being investigated by German authorities for anti-competitive behavior.

### Ryanair says yes to labor unions

Faced with the threat of a labor strike during the peak holiday travel period, Ryanair, the European budget carrier, has decided to recognize labor unions. CEO Michael O'Leary [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ryanair-pilots-unions/defiant-oleary-says-union-recognition-sets-stage-for-ryanair-expansion-idUSKBN1ED230?il=0) the decision would allow the airline to expand while keeping costs down. But he also warned that the company will not accept unreasonable demands from unions.

#### Why does this matter?

Because it allows Ryanair to operate this peak season without disruptions. This means smoother travel for approximately 150,000 travelers with Ryanair bookings this season. The airline industry is heavily unionized and while it had been able to avoid unionization of its workers for the last 30 years in business, Ryanair had been facing increased pressure from pilots who are demanding better pay and working conditions. Last week, its pilots in Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Germany [said](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42320733) they were planning to go on strike during the holiday season.

#### Our take

It was a only matter of time before Ryanair recognizes unions anyway. Ryanair shareholders were unhappy but the company saves itself the headache of having to manage a disruptive labor strike.
