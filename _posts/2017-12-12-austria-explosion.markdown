### Explosion in Austrian natural gas facility

A gas plant in Austria today caught fire and [exploded](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/italy-declares-state-emergency-gas-explosion-austria), endangering gas supply to southern Europe. The explosion resulted in the death of one person and the injury of at least 18 others. Authorities attributed the incident to a technical problem. The explosion occurred in Baumgarten, a major European gas hub north of Vienna.

#### A cold winter in Europe

The gas facility, operated by [Gas Connect](http://www.gasconnect.at/en) is a major redistribution center for natural gas from Eastern Europe to other parts of Western Europe. Therefore, an accident like this would halt or slow down the flow of gas to the west. Natural gas prices in Europe jumped in reaction to the incident, while Italy declared a [state of emergency](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/italy-declares-state-emergency-gas-explosion-austria) due to gas shortages. The explosion in Austria occurred just a day after an oil pipeline that carries oil from the North Sea for processing in Scotland had to be [closed](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-42322771) due to a crack that may lead to an oil leak if unattended.

#### Our take

Oil, gas and coal still account for roughly 70% of [energy consumption](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Energy_trends) in Europe, and in the last year, gas consumption in the region even [rose](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2017/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2017-full-report.pdf) because of lower prices relative to coal and renewables. This makes the region susceptible to the market impacts of accidents and infrastructure problems. While renewable energy consumption has been [increasing](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Renewable_energy_statistics#Main_statistical_findings), current volumes are inadequate to make up for the gas shortages. Winter has arrived.

### Facebook changes tax structure

Facebook has [announced](https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-tax-digital-europe-revenue-sales-corporate-ireland-david-wehner/) that it is will start booking sales in the country where a sale is made, and would stop routing sales to lower tax zones, such as Ireland. Facebook CFO said the new structure “will provide more transparency to governments and policy makers...who have called for greater visibility over the revenue associated with locally-supported sales in their countries.”

#### The tax man is coming

Facebook and other technology firms are facing intense regulatory scrutiny in Europe for booking sales in European countries to a subsidiary in Ireland to avail if Ireland's lower tax rate. In 2016, the European Commission ordered Apple to pay $14.5 billion in [back taxes](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/30/491984277/european-commission-orders-apple-to-pay-14-5-billion-in-taxes). While the use of tax havens is not illegal, governments especially those in Europe have been going after tax havens and corporations that use them. Tax avoidance deprives countries of revenues to finance the things that governments spend on like social welfare programs, infrastructure, and healthcare, among others.

#### Our take

At face value, Facebook’s announcement suggests that the company will be paying more taxes in the countries where it generates revenues. This sounds good for the countries, right? But some [say](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42324485) this is not necessarily the case because taxes are also based on profits. For large companies, determining profits is not as simple as subtracting expenses from revenues; their accounting processes are way more complex. So while Facebook's tax rates may rise, there is a possibility that it may not actually pay more taxes than it already does. We wanted to like this measure, but we need to wait before we press "thumbs up".

### Stay on mining ban in Grand Canyon

A federal appeals court today [upheld](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mining-grandcanyon/u-s-court-upholds-grand-canyon-uranium-mining-ban-but-allows-mine-nearby-idUSKBN1E62LO) a ban imposed by former President Obama on mining in the Grand Canyon area. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco rules that “Withdrawal of the area from new mining claims for a limited period will permit more careful, longer-term study of the uncertain effects of uranium in the area and better-informed decision making in the future.” However, the court allowed the opening a uranium mine operated by Energy Fuels near the south rim.

#### This is a BFD

Heeding the concerns of environmental advocates and Native American tribes, Obama imposed a mining ban around the Grand Canyon in 2012. Advocacy groups say that mining poses significant risks to water supply and biodiversity in the area. The National Mining Association has been trying to get this ban overturned by the courts but to no avail. Therefore, today's court decision was a big victory for Grand Canyon activists under an administration that is perceived to be less environmentally-friendly than its predecessor.

#### But it's too early for a victory lap

Because last week, President Trump reduced the size of two national monuments in Utah, an act that many believe was intended to open up the area to more mining activities. The previous week, the US Senate passed a tax bill that included a provision to open parts of the Alaska National Wildlife refuge to oil and gas exploration. These parallel developments are a ray of hope for the mining industry. This means that for the National Mining Association, the next battlefront may be the US Congress, which has proven to be friendlier to mining interests than the courts. And there, the battle may be just be won.
