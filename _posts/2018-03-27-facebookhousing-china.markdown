### Facebook alleged to have enabled discrimination in housing ads

A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/nyregion/facebook-housing-ads-discrimination-lawsuit.html" target="_blank">federal lawsuit has been filed against Facebook</a>, for allegedly enabling discriminatory behavior by real estate brokers and landlords. The lawsuit filed by fair housing groups claimed that Facebook's customization features allowed real estate agents to discriminate against certain groups such as single mothers, disabled veterans and minorities by withholding housing ads from their Facebook pages.

#### What's the violation here?

The lawsuit alleged that Facebook violated the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits the publication of housing ads that indicate preferences or imposes restrictions based on race, color, religion, handicaps, familial status or national origin. The groups are seeking a court order for Facebook to remove features that enable advertisers to limit viewership of their ads only to preferred demographics.

#### Throwback 2016

In investigative reports published in 2016, ProPublica pointed to discrimination in housing ads that are enabled by Facebook's customization features. Facebook committed to disable the use of "ethnic affinity marketing" for ads involving housing, employment and credit. Last year, the company said it has a policy of prohibiting discriminatory ads.

#### Our take

Discrimination against certain groups of people is a big deal. In the past, cases such as discriminatory lending and redlining have been ruled in favor of those who felt discriminated against. Facebook cannot use the same excuse that it is merely the platform for ads because it has enabled features that provide advertisers the tools to exclude certain groups of people from viewing their ads. And we thought things were bad enough for Zuck.

### China goes for the goal

China today <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/380437-china-says-it-has-met-2020-climate-goal" target="_blank">claimed that it has met its 2020 goal</a> of reducing carbon emissions by 40 to 45% of GDP. Xie Zhenhua, Chinaâ€™s special representative for climate change, said China achieved a 46% reduction under 2005 levels in 2017. Year-over-year, China reduced its carbon intensity by 5.1%.

#### Mixed Signals

There is no independent verification of China's claim especially that it follows a report by <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2018/03/23/carbon-mining.html" target="_blank">the International Energy Agency (IEA) that China's emissions last year grew by 1.7%</a>. Asia, including China, were the big drivers of a record increase in global emissions last year.

#### Why does this matter?

If its claim is true, China becomes the first large carbon emitter to meet its Paris commitment way ahead of schedule. This is a big boost because China is a big source of emissions after all. Nonetheless, there is indeed clear evidence that the country is serious about reducing carbon emissions through a combination of renewable energy deployment, diversification of energy sources, and enforcement of environmental protection laws. Looks like Beijing is slayin' it.
