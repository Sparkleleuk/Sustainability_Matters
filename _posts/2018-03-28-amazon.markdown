### Amazon is the subject of Trump's "obsession"

President Trump is <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-regulation-amazon-facebook-646c642c-a2d7-454b-a9a9-cdc6e4eaef2c.html" target="_blank">reportedly "obsessed" with Amazon</a> and is looking into clipping Jeff Bezos' wings with different regulatory measures. Axios reported that Trump has discussed the possibility of using taxes and the anti-trust law to curb Amazon's expansion.

#### Not so noble intentions

Trump is reportedly eyeing regulatory measures against Amazon because his associates have complained that Amazon is destroying their business and is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers. Trump has repeatedly, although wrongly, insisted that the US Postal Service is giving Amazon a free ride. And finally, many believe that Trump is wary of Amazon owning The Washington Post. 

#### Why does this matter?

While Trump may be going after Amazon for the wrong reasons, Amazon's size is increasingly a concern. Like Facebook, Amazon huge amounts of private data that remains unregulated and attractive to third party users. Amazon appears to have done a better job than Facebook in protecting private data but the more Amazon expands, the more data it collects. In January, <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/healthcare/human%20rights/2018/01/31/amazon-healthcare.html" target="_blank">Amazon partnered with insurance company Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to pilot a low-cost healthcare service</a>. This means that Amazon will have access to even more sensitive medical data of private individuals. Cause for concern, don't you think?

#### Our take

We shop in Amazon, like everyone else. But the idea of one company becoming the one-stop shop for everything from pet food to medical services makes us pause and wonder this is getting too <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18302455-the-circle" target="_blank">The Circle</a>-ish. Kalden, you there bro?

#### **Quote of the day: "All hands on deck"**

<em>It is metastasizing rapidly out of North Charleston and I just heard 777 (automated spar assembly tools) may have gone down.</em> ~ Mike VanderWel, chief engineer at Boeing Commercial Airplane production engineering, in a memo after Boeing was hit by WannaCry.
