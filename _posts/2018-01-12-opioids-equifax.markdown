### Opioid emergency expires in two weeks

President Trump's declaration of the opioid crisis as a public health emergency is set to expire on January 23, but public health officials say the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/11/opioids-epidemic-trump-addiction-emergency-order-335848" target="_blank">declaration did not help</a> address the problem. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/26/politics/donald-trump-opioid-epidemic/index.html" target="_blank">public health emergency in October 2017</a> but did not authorize the release of new  funding to assist in emergency response. The declaration is good for 90 days, and a group of senators have <a href="https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/press-releases/opioid-public-health-emergency" target="_blank">urged Trump to renew it</a>.

#### Why does this matter?

Opioid overdose has killed 300,000 Americans since 2000 and in 2015 alone, the crisis <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/healthcare/environment/2017/11/21/drugged.html" target="_blank">cost the US economy $504 billion</a>. The epidemic has also been blamed for a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/12/21/u-s-life-expectancy-drops-second-year-drug-deaths-spike-cdc/970283001/" target="_blank"> drop in the US life expectancy</a> for the second year in a row in 2017.

#### Our take

The Trump government said it <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-taking-action-drug-addiction-opioid-crisis/" target="_blank">has mobilized resources</a> to address the epidemic. Given the scale of the problem, however, Trump clearly needs to do more.

### Equifax was the most unloved finance company in 2017

Credit bureau Equifax Inc. obtained the most number of consumer complaints in 49 US states in 2017, according to <a href="https://lendedu.com/blog/us-heatmap-cfpb-complaints" target="_blank">an analysis of data</a> from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). LendEDU, a financial resources website, analyzed complaints filed with the bureau said that Equifax received 30,576 complaints across the country. North Dakota was the only state where Equifax wasn't the most complained about financial company. Experian, another credit bureau, had the highest number of complaints there.

#### Remind me of Equifax again

Equifax admitted in September last year, that it had been hacked and that private and sensitive information such as Social Security numbers of more than 140 million US residents were compromised. But what made it worse was that the admission came more than a month after the company discovered the breach on July 29, 2017. Then Equifax angered people by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/it-costs-consumers-4-point-1-billion-to-freeze-credit-reports.html" target="_blank">charging for a credit freeze</a>. The company later reversed its decision.

#### Our take

Equifax is facing a federal investigation and a number of consumer lawsuits for the data breach. The number of complaints with the CFPB confirms that the company is in for a lot more problems. In the meantime, our sensitive data are somewhere...floating...in...the...cloud.
