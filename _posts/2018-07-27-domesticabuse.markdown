### Domestic violence victims to get 10 days off and other benefits

New Zealand's parliament has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/26/new-zealand-paid-domestic-violence-leave-jan-logie" target="_blank">passed a landmark bill</a> that grants 10 days paid leave to victims of domestic violence to give them time to leave their partners, find new homes and protect themselves and their children. The bill also entitles victims to flexible work conditions to ensure their safety. The bill was passed with a vote of 63-57.

#### Why does NZ need such a law?

New Zealand police responds to a family violence incident every four minutes, which suggests that domestic violence accounts for a quarter of all police-related incidents in the country. Supporters of the bill say New Zealand's domestic abuse rates are "endemic" and "horrifying", and cost the country between NZ$4.1 billion and $7 billion a year. But opponents say the bill imposes a costly burden on small and medium businesses.

#### But NZ is not alone...

The <a href="http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women" target="_blank">World Health Organization estimates</a> that 1 in 3 women all over the world (or 35%) experience violence by a partner, and as many as 38% of murders of women globally are committed by an intimate partner. You'll also find more stats <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/gender/vaw/" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Why does this matter?

Because domestic violence has human and economic costs. Victims and their immediate family bear the trauma of violence and impacts their relationships with themselves and society (think PTSD). It then impacts productivity and employment opportunities, and imposes a cost on healthcare. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/women/endviolence/situation.shtml" target="_blank">UN says</a> the economic cost of domestic violence in the US, for example, exceeds $5.8 billion annually. In the United Kingdom, the cost is roughly £23 billion per year or £440 per person.
