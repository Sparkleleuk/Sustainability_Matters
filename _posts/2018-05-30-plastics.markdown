### More countries opt to ban plastics, starting with Chile

The Chilean parliament voted on May 30 to <a href="http://santiagotimes.cl/2018/05/31/chile-set-to-become-first-american-country-to-ban-plastic-bags/" target="_blank">ban plastic bags</a> in all shops across the country. The proposal will then go through Chile’s Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Chile’s congress. If approved, the ban will take effect in a year’s time for large retailers, and two years for smaller shops. The ban was initially planned for the Patagonia region but was expanded to the entire country.

#### And in Europe...

The European Commission has proposed a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-28/life-in-plastic-not-fantastic-eu-says-in-clampdown-proposals" target="_blank">total ban on some single-use plastic products</a> such as cotton buds, cutlery, plates, straws, drink stirrers and sticks for balloons. The EC is also proposing the reduction in the use of plastic food containers and drinking cups. The proposal requires European Union member states to collect 90% of single-use plastic drink bottles by 2025, while plastics producers will be required to contribute to waste management.

#### Why do these proposals matter?

Because plastics are the new CFCs, or close it at least. According to a <a href="http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/governments-need-to-act-to-encourage-plastic-recycling-markets.htm" target="_blank">study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>, just 14% to 18% of waste plastics are recycled, 24% is thermally treated and the rest - or more than 50% - go to landfills, are openly burned, or are dumped in waterways and oceans. Last month, the UK moved to ban single-use plastics and called on other Commonwealth member states to do the same. The proposed ban in Chile is widely supported and has already been implemented in a number of communes. In many parts of Europe, plastic bags have been banned a long long time ago, while the use of single-use plastics has generally been lower than in the US. We won’t be surprised if these proposals are approved. They are needed and way overdue. Where art thou, America?

**BEFORE YOU GO...**

#### **We're reading**

The <a href="https://www.iea.org/gevo2018/" target="_blank">Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2018</a> report by the International Energy Agency. More than one million electric vehicles (EVs) were sold in 2017, a 54% increase from 2016. There are now three million hybrid or electric vehicles on the road. Meanwhile, Hamburg's partial ban on old diesel vehicles in two major streets <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/hamburg-partial-diesel-transport-ban-goes-into-effect/a-44014953" target="_blank">took effect</a>. Remember, diesel = Germany, so this news is whoa! This is the moment when you realize that the years of diesel dominance are numbered.
