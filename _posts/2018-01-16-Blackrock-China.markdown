### BlackRock calls for positive impact by companies

BlackRock, the world's largest investment manager by assets under management, has put publicly-listed companies on notice. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/business/dealbook/blackrock-laurence-fink-letter.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fbusiness-dealbook&action=click&contentCollection=dealbook&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=4&pgtype=sectionfront" target="_blank">New York Times reported</a> that BlackRock was set to send letters to publicly-listed companies to not only make money, but also to create positive impact. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/16/business/dealbook/document-BlackRock-s-Laurence-Fink-Urges-C-E-O-s-to-Focus.html?dlbk" target="_blank">draft of the letter</a> published by the Times, states: "Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate."

#### Why does this matter?

With $5.7 trillion under assets, BlackRock is the world's largest investor and therefore, has the market power to the challenge the status quo and drive change in corporate behavior. Remember when Milton Friedman said that "the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits"? Well, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink obviously thinks that it's passé. Touché.

#### Our take

BlackRock's call to action may be life-changing especially for companies that have long held the view that their only responsibility is to make money for shareholders. BlackRock is not a non-profit that they can ignore or an activist investor that they can overpower. BlackRock is one of them and is of the same fold. This may just be the big catalyst to make companies more responsible, because who wants to annoy the world's largest investor?

### Fears of marine contamination from oil spill in China

An oil spill caused by a collision between an oil tanker and a freighter in the East China Sea last week, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/world/asia/oil-tanker-spill-sanchi-east-china-sea.html?_r=0" target="_blank">has expanded</a>, creating fears of contamination of marine life. The tanker was carrying 136,000 tons of highly flammable fuel oil and the collision triggered an oil slick that has since then grown to 52 square miles from four square miles in two days. The oil slick has also been pushed closer to Japan by strong winds and is now just 200 miles from Naha, the capital city of Okinawa.

#### Who is doing what?

China's foreign ministry said it is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/16/asia/china-sanchi-oil-spill-environmental-impact-intl/index.html" target="_blank">closely monitoring</a> the oil slick and that it is investigating the potential impact on aquatic life. Initial tests have already found a high petroleum concentration around the spill. China has <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42690247" target="_blank">deployed at least two ships</a> to clean up the spill before it spreads further.

#### Why does this matter?

Chinese scientists are looking into <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2128527/chinese-scientists-offer-three-possible-scenarios-east-china-sea" target="_blank">three possible scenarios</a>. First, that the oil slick would spread and strong winds and ocean currents would push it north all the way to the United States. A second scenario would be that the impacts would be localized and limited to the area around the East Asia Sea. A third scenario would be that the impacts would be negligible if the oil moves to the Pacific Ocean, where it can easily be diluted.

Greenpeace, however, noted that the area is rich in fish and other aquatic species, and is on the migratory pathway of whales. The oil slick could endanger marine life and disrupt whales' migratory patterns, which may have long-term negative impacts on fish supply and biodiversity. Contamination also impacts the food chain.
