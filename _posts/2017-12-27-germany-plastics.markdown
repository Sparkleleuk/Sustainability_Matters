title:  "Negative Power Price is a Thing"
excerpt: "Germany's power prices go negative on Christmas, but hold your horses, this does not necessarily translate to more money for consumers. Investments in plastic production are likely to lead to 'permanent pollution'."

### German power prices drop to sub-zero over Christmas weekend

Power prices in Germany <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/business/energy-environment/germany-electricity-negative-prices.html?_r=0" target="_blank">plunged below zero</a> on Christmas Eve and for a few hours on Christmas Day, an increasingly common occurrence in the EPEX Spot exchange. The drop in prices was attributed to low demand, unseasonably warm weather, and an increase in wind power during that period.

This is a cause for celebration, right? Hmmm, not really. Bear with us on this one.

#### What is driving down the price?

It's the law of supply and demand. During the Christmas weekend, Germany's sources of power generated more electricity than German consumers and industries needed. In 2017 alone, there have been <a href="https://blog.energybrainpool.com/en/already-103-times-negative-electricity-prices-at-the-spot-market" target="_blank"> at least 100 instances</a> where power prices dropped below zero, making Germany the European country where negative power prices are most common.

#### What's with the oversupply?

Like most countries, Germany generates electricity from a host of sources ranging from nuclear, coal and natural gas to renewable energy. However, The electric utility sector has yet to find a way to make sure that power surges from one source triggers a reduction from other sources. On Christmas Eve, wind power became suddenly abundant but other sources of electricity such as coal and nuclear were producing the same amount per normal. And these power sources cannot be switched on and switched off at will. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2016/02/19/negative-electricity-prices-are-not-a-sign-of-renewable-success/2/#790b74aa2fb3" target="_blank">sudden</a> (and unpredictable) abundance of power from renewable energy sources has, in fact, contributed to negative power price.

#### Is negative the new positive?

It depends on the type of user. Industries benefit from the lower price of power in the spot market because they are the primary consumers of wholesale power. For households, the actual cost of power is just about a fifth of a utility bill and the rest is composed of taxes and other fees (like fees to support the development of renewable energy). Therefore, a drop in the wholesale price of power may not necessarily translate into lower power bills for the average German consumer. In fact, utility bills have been going up despite the price drops.

#### P.S. Holy bologna!

**BEFORE YOU GO**

#### **We've been reading**

A <a href="http://www.ciel.org/reports/fuelingplastics/" target="_blank">series of reports</a> by the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) point out that increasing investments by energy and chemical companies in the plastics industry is putting the environment at risk of "permanent pollution". The reports point out that more and more oil companies own plastic producers, while more plastic producers now own oil operations. Oil and chemicals are becoming the OTP.
