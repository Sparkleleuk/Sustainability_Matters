### Drilling in the Arctic: Don't even think about it

Investors are supporting an indigenous group in <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/blog/Investor%20Arctic%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge%20Letter%205.11.pdf" target="_blank">calling for energy companies not to in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>, warning that companies that continue to do so face financial and reputational risks. The group of international investors include asset managers and asset owners controlling a total of $2.5 trillion in assets.

#### The backstory please

The US Congress reopened part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration as part of the Trump government's new tax law passed in December 2017. Proponents of the law say drilling will provide jobs and income to the state of Alaska. Critics are concerned over the lasting environmental impacts of drilling in one of the last remaining pristine forests in the world.

#### What are investors saying?

A few things. First, that investing in the Artic Refuge operations "would be an irresponsible business decision" as global trends move away from fossil fuels towards clean technologies. Second, that energy companies and the banks that lend them capital face "enormous reputational risk and public backlash. Their brands would be associated with destroying pristine wilderness, contributing to the climate crisis, and trampling on human rights."

#### What is the local community saying?

The Arctic Refuge is home to the Gwich'in, an Alaska native tribe and the tribe is concerned that oil and gas drilling "would degrade the health" of the caribou herd, which comprise up to 80% of the tribe's diet. The tribe believes that this activity constitutes a violation of its human rights.

#### Why does this matter?

For obvious reasons, the climate and the environment. Oil and gas exploration is inherently damaging to the environment and risks are magnified in harsh conditions like the Arctic. The damage is irreversible and irremediable, and as we all know, damage in the Arctic has wide-ranging impacts beyond the Arctic region.

#### **We're reading**

California's <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/climate-change/report/2018caindicatorsreportmay2018.pdf" target="_blank">May 2018 report on Indicators of Climate Change</a> and while the state has made a lot of progress in climate change mitigation, things are still not looking good. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to increase and these also increase ocean acidification. Temperatures continue to increase, which means the state is getting warmer year after year, and also getting drier. Finally, sea levels are rising in the California coast. State officials are getting worried, and for good reason.
