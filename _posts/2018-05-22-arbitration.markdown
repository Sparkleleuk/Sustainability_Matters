### Supreme Court favors arbitration over class actions

The US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/21/supreme-court-upholds-employers-right-to-require-arbitration-to-settle-workplace-disputes-600923" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on May 21 that companies may require their employees to waive their right to participate in class action lawsuits. The decision was reached via a vote of 5-4 on three pending cases filed with the high court. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who penned the ruling, said the court’s decision was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/business/supreme-court-upholds-workplace-arbitration-contracts.html" target="_blank">dictated by federal laws favoring arbitration</a> and the court’s precedents. He pointed out that allowing workers to band together in class actions would undermine the “virtues” of arbitration such as speed, simplicity and inexpensiveness.

#### Beyond the legalese

This decision essentially confirms a common practice by employers to prohibit employers from filing complaints in a class. Instead, employees will still be required to file complaints individually and pursue them in arbitration. <a href="https://adr.findlaw.com/arbitration/what-is-arbitration-.html" target="_blank">Arbitration</a> is often criticized as a process that favors companies because it allows them to negotiate with complainants behind closed doors, and helps them avoid the reputational risk associated with public legal actions, such as class action lawsuits, which typically attract media attention. Critics of this mandatory clause also say that arbitration helps companies avoid public scrutiny especially if workplace misconduct is chronic.

#### Our take

At the root of this legal issue are labor rights and the right of workers to seek legal redress. A class action lawsuit is the best chance employees have to pursue complaints over systemic labor rights violations against a more well-oiled corporate legal team. By favoring arbitration, the Supreme Court is effectively undermining labor rights and giving a strong signal that companies still reign supreme.

**ICYMI**

#### Dodd-Frank is watered down

The US Senate today rolled back a number of financial regulations set up to prevent a repeat of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. The Senate passed a bill that frees smaller banks from restrictions on capital and other regulatory requirements. For example, smaller banks will no longer be required to undergo stress tests to evaluate if they can withstand an economic meltdown. Supporters of the bill say the rollback will free up capital for lending and financing. The bill is up for President Trump's signature.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/business/congress-passes-dodd-frank-rollback-for-smaller-banks.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur" target="_blank">Read it to believe it</a>.
