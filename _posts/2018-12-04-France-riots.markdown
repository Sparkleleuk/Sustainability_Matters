### France postpones fuel taxes

French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/france-backs-down-delays-tax-increases-after-paris-riots-n943381" target="_blank">announced</a> that the government is suspending the imposition of fuel taxes amidst the worst urban riots in the country. France will postpone the taxes for six months.

#### Yellow jackets

Demonstrations have been carried out in Paris and parts of France since mid-November to protest planned taxes on gas and diesel. Violence erupted over the weekend in Paris, with more than 100 people were injured and more than 400 were arrested. The demonstrations were organized by the "Yellow Jacket" movement, a protest group organized via social media.

#### Why raise taxes?

President Emmanuel Macrons imposed taxes on fuel to pay for climate mitigation measures. Macron has committed to cut carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.

#### Why does this matter?

Climate action can be politically risky. As progressive governments scramble to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, they meet vigorous opposition from their own citizens, which could delay or derail well-meaning intentions.

**SPEAKING OF THE CLIMATE...**

#### **UN issues dire warning**

A UN report issued late November said carbon emissions projected by countries fall short of the 2 degree Celsius goal set in Paris in 2015. The UN warned that with the rate things are going, the average global temperature would rise to 3.2 degrees Celsius by 2100. Yikes.
