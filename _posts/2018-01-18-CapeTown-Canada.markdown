### Fearing "Day Zero", Cape Town further cuts water allowance

Cape Town, the second most populous city in South Africa, is <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42731084" target="_blank">set to further reduce water allowance</a> for its residents starting February because of fears that the city will run out of water. Saying that the city has reached a "point of no return", city mayor Patricia de Lille authorized the reduction of water allowance to 50 liters (approximately 13.2 gallons) from 87 liters (approximately 23 gallons), the current daily limit. The new allowance takes effect on February 1st.

#### Why is this happening?

Parts of South Africa are experiencing their worst drought in a century; there has hardly been any rain for three yeas. At least five provinces have already been declared as disaster areas. Cape Town dams are currently at 28% capacity and is expected to go down to 13% on April 21st - Day Zero. If Day Zero materializes, Cape Town becomes the first major urban center to run out of water, literally. Taps will run dry and residents will have to line up for water. Meanwhile, the water levels in <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-01-17-eastern-cape-drought-rapidly-overtaking-the-cape-town-crisis/#.WmE_cJM-dWM" target="_blank">Eastern Cape</a>, a neighboring province, has dropped to a perilous level of 7.9%.

#### Emergency measures...

Are up and running. Cape Town earlier cut the water allowance to 87 liters and banned a number of water-consuming activities like filling swimming pools and car washing. It also urged residents to minimize water use, including (gulp) cutting down shower time to two minutes and flushing the toilet only when necessary. Similar restrictions and warnings are in place in drought-affected areas. But the Cape Town mayor has also blamed some residents and businesses for using water more than what is allowed.

#### Our take

Scientists say the drought is a <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/01/extreme-drought-grips-parts-south-africa-180118092847342.html" target="_blank">"once in a millennium event"</a>. The drought is consistent with the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/" target="_blank">continuing rise in global temperatures</a>. As South Africa goes dry, temperatures in Australia are pushing 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Is there still any doubt that climate change is real?

### Canada wants to keep a closer eye on its businesses abroad

Canada is <a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN1F62AL-OCABS" target="_blank">forming an independent watchdog</a> to monitor human rights impacts of Canadian businesses abroad. The Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise will investigate allegations of human rights violations and will have the power to recommend sanctions against misbehaving companies. The new watchdog will focus on mining, oil and gas, and garments companies.

#### Why does this matter?

Canada is a resource-based economy with a number of large extractive companies operating in developing countries. Civil society groups have been calling for closer oversight of their activities following allegations of human rights violations by companies such as Nevsun Resources, Tahoe Resources, and Barrick Gold, among others. Companies found by the new watchdog to be violating human rights face financial repercussions, such as withdrawal of support by Export Development Canada.

#### Our take

Independent, third-party monitoring is important in making sure that companies are doing what they say they are doing. Thus, this watchdog could be an important catalyst to improving corporate behavior.
