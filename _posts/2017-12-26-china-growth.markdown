### China lowers growth rate tolerance to tackle pollution and debt

China has [signaled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-25/china-signals-slower-growth-is-acceptable-to-tackle-debt-smog) that a growth rate lower than its target would be ok, suggesting that the country is intent on addressing debt and the pollution. A senior Communist Party official said that an annual growth rate of 6.3% instead of China's official minimum annual growth rate of 6.5% from 2018 to 2020 "would do". The deputy head of the State Council research office also said in a recent article in the official Economic Daily that the economy only needs to grow by 6.3% a year and residential income by 5.3 percent to reach the targets of doubling 2020 GDP and per capita income from 2010 levels.

#### What does this mean?

China's rapid economic acceleration is linked to an equally rapid pace of industrial activity, which has resulted in high levels of pollution across the country. In the past, China had been unwilling to compromise on its growth targets, as it needed continued high growth to lift its citizens out of poverty. This recent statement by Yang Weimin, an official from the Communist Party committee overseeing economic policy, indicates a departure from Beijing's strict adherence to its growth targets. Similarly, Beijing has [signaled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-25/pboc-official-says-local-government-bankruptcies-are-needed) that it might let local governments who over-borrowed go bankrupt to mitigate systemic financial risks.

#### Why the change of heart?

Pollution in China has reached extreme levels, and has been blamed for the [death of 1.1 million people](http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/27/news/economy/china-crackdown-pollution-economy/index.html) in the country in 2015 alone. Three years ago, Beijing pledged to address environmental problems and its intensified anti-pollution campaign is expected by economists to impact GDP growth. It has become increasingly clear to Beijing that it cannot pursue a high economic growth target without a cost. 

#### I don't live in China, what's this got to do with me?

China is now the world's fastest growing economy and is expected to [become](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-26/china-to-overtake-u-s-economy-by-2032-as-asian-might-builds) the largest economy by 2032. Anything it does will reverberate across the world. China is also one of the highest carbon emitters in the world and its failure, or success, in curbing emissions impacts the world's ability to mitigate climate risks. We all have a stake in a cleaner, greener China.
