### The stories that made us shake our heads

*TL;DR: Cybersecurity, healthcare, taxes, and the environment made us worry in 2017.*

*Warning: This entry can be depressing and may be unsuitable for this festive season. Parental guidance is advised. But an uplifting entry is coming soon. Stay tuned.*

#### **Alt-ctrl-delete**

After the big <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/consumer/clark-howard/clark-your-life/equifax-data-breach-a-look-back-at-our-biggest-story-of-2017/671146350" target="_blank"> Equifax hack</a> that left 143 million of us in America wondering who's using our social security numbers now, **cybersecurity** has officially become that THING that everyone fears but is resigned to. We fear our digital lives, but we know that our info is increasingly public commodity, and worse, there is nothing we can do about it. 2017 saw some pretty devastating cybersecurity breaches, such as the <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/consumer/clark-howard/clark-your-life/equifax-data-breach-a-look-back-at-our-biggest-story-of-2017/671146350" target="_blank">WannaCry ransomeware attack</a> and the <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/04/intercontinental-hotel-chain-breach-expands/" target="_blank"> hack on more than 1,200 Intercontinental Hotel Group properties</a>. And then there was the annoying <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/ethics/csr/privacy/2017/11/21/throttled.html" target="_blank">failure by Uber</a> to tell us and their drivers that hey, our info had also been stolen, but Uber sorted it out by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/uber-concealed-cyberattack-that-exposed-57-million-people-s-data" target="_blank">paying off the hackers</a> to delete the stolen data. Whaaaat, say again?

And it's not just identity theft that made us shake our head. Fake news, hate speech and extremist sites aggravated us. And now we know that Facebook, Twitter, Google and other technology wizards <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/human%20rights/labor/csr/2017/12/19/hate-speech.html" target="_blank">provided the platform</a> for these views to propagate, but did not act immediately until it was too late. Silicon Valley is experiencing too many runtime errors.

#### **Health is wealth**

Not in America. The **opioid crisis** <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/healthcare/environment/2017/11/21/drugged.html" target="_blank">turned out to have a bigger impact on the US economy</a> than previously thought. There is a $ figure to this crisis: $504 billion cost to the economy in 2015 alone. Not to mention loses in productivity for those with addiction and their caregivers. And drug overdoses are to blame for the lower life expectancy in the US. In 2016, the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioid-fentanyl-overdose-deaths-us-life-expectancy-drops-for-second-year/" target="_blank">US life expectancy dropped for the second year in the row</a>, the first consecutive drop in more than 50 years.  President Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html?_r=0" target="_blank"> asked the Department of Health and Human Services to declare the epidemic as a public health emergency</a> but did not authorize the release of $$$ to address it, which makes the declaration symbolic more than anything. In yet another blow to healthcare access, the **new tax reform law** <a href="http://time.com/money/5043622/gop-tax-reform-bill-individual-mandate/" target="_blank">removes the requirement for all Americans to be insured</a>, which means that, well, you can be uninsured and get away with it. Until you get terribly sick. And then you realized you're f'ed. But CVS is promising better access to preventive care through <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/healthcare/environment/2017/12/04/merger.html" target="_blank">its merger with Aetna</a>, so maybe you're not going to get terribly sick after all. Healthcare status: It's complicated.

#### **Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes**

Corporate America and the wealthy are certain they will pay lower taxes for life (unless the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is repealed). Even while they siphon money away to tropical tax havens because they can. The <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/ethics/csr/2017/11/10/offcourse1.html" target="_blank">Paradise Papers investigation</a> showed that our favorite companies have been moving money to offshore accounts to avoid getting taxed in the US. But in Europe, many US companies are under fire for routing sales revenues to Ireland, which is a low tax domicile, forcing <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/ethics/environment/2017/12/12/austria-explosion.html" target="_blank">Facebook to pledge to the European Commission to stop routing sales to Ireland</a>, so are we cool now?

What's coming in 2018 is more debate on taxes especially in the run-up to the mid-term elections.  Everyone buckle up. The Koch brothers is <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/25/koch-brothers-group-set-to-boost-conservative-candidates-policies-with-400-million-between-now-and-2018.html" target="_blank">spending lotsa money to promote the benefits of the new tax law</a>. 2018 is going to be one helluva of a ride.

#### **It's the environment, stupid**

The environment took a beating under Trump's first year in the White House. In fact, there were too many stories, but too little space to list every single thing that made us shake our heads. From the <a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2017-atlantic-hurricane-season-through-september" target="_blank">summer hurricanes</a> that hammered the southern US and Caribbean islands and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/26/us/2017-california-wildfire-records-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">the wildfires in California</a>, to Trump's plan to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/16/politics/trump-paris-climate-deal/index.html" target="_blank">withdraw from the Paris Agreement</a>, the <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/csr/2017/11/13/emissions.html" target="_blank">rise in global carbon emissions</a> barely three years before 2020, the increasing <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/finance/2017/11/22/smog.html" target="_blank"> air</a> and water pollution, the <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2017/12/03/tax-bill.html" target="_blank">opening up of protected lands</a> in the US to <a href="http://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/diversity/2017/11/30/drilling-diversity.html" target="_blank">oil drilling and mining</a>, to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/climate/epa-buyouts-pruitt.html" target="_blank">departures at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a>, all these point to some serious troubles ahead. And with the northern half of the US and Canada experiencing record low temperatures that are finally worthy of a Canada Goose "Big Red" parka, Trump's <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/946531657229701120" target="_blank">tweet that "we need a bit of global warming"</a> is enough to make us say, WTF.

BTW, nearly half of the 1.5 million Puerto Rican electricity subscribers are still <a href="http://wreg.com/2017/12/29/3-months-after-maria-barely-half-of-puerto-rico-has-power/" target="_blank">without power</a> three months after Hurricane Maria.
