### Ban on new oil and gas explorations passed in parliament

A bill that will ban new oil and gas explorations in New Zealand has <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12156258" target="_blank">passed its final reading</a> and is set to become law. The Crown Minerals (Petroleum) Amendment Bill passed on November 7 with the support of three parties, with two other parties opposing.

#### The start of the end

It all started in April when New Zealandâ€™s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern <a href="https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/planning-future-no-new-offshore-oil-and-gas-exploration-permits" target="_blank">announced</a> that her government will stop issuing new licenses for offshore oil and gas drilling as part of its goal to be carbon neutral by 2050. The government will allow the existing 22 active offshore permits covering 38,000 square to run until their expiration, and could be converted into mining permits that could extend for another 40 years. The oil and gas industry opposed the move, and so did the local government of Taranaki, where most offshore oil and gas fields are based.

#### Why does this matter?

The local petroleum industry estimates that New Zealand is potentially rich in offshore oil and gas. There are 17 sedimentary basins surrounding the country, which have possible commercial quantities of oil and gas, but only one basin, Taranaki, has been explored and developed. There has also been a drop in exploration in recent years due to the drop in oil prices, and the industry expects gas supply to start dwindling by 2020. New Zealand has effectively put a cap on developing all the other sediment basins at the risk of spending more for imports.

#### **Google responds to the global employee walkout**

A few days after thousands of employees walked out of their jobs to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment allegations, Google made adjustments to its employee policy. It agreed to some of the employee demands, but not to all. It's #TimesUp indeed for Silicon Valley.
