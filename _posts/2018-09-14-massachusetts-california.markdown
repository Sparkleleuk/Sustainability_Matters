### Dozens of gas explosions rock three towns outside Boston

Dozens of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-massachusetts-explosions/boston-suburbs-gas-pipeline-accident-biggest-since-2010-idUSKCN1LU0W6" target="_blank">gas explosions</a> on September 13 have killed one person, injured more than a dozen people, and left 8,000 homeless in three towns north of Boston. The explosions occurred in the towns of Andover, Lawrence and North Andover and also left approximately 18,000 homes and businesses without power.

#### Yikes

Yep. The explosions caused fires that were the biggest in the state in a decade. Massachusetts Governor Charles Baker declared a state of emergency and ordered an investigation into the gas pipeline of Columbia Gas, a subsidiary of NiSource Inc., which exploded and triggered all the other explosions inside homes. Baker also directed Eversource Energy (ES.N), a rival utility company, in charge of the response to the explosion, replacing Columbia Gas.

#### What's Columbia Gas saying?

Columbia Gas President Steven Bryant <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/boston/index.ssf/2018/09/columbia_gas_president_apologi.html" target="_blank">publicly apologized</a> for the "inconvenience" caused by the explosions. The apology came after state and local officials criticized the company for responding late to the incident and failing to sufficiently communicate to the public. Bryant said residents may start returning to their homes by the weekend. The Boston area and its suburbs are served by one of the <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2018/09/14/boston-merrimack-valley-cast-iron-natural-gas-pipes-aging-infrastructure/1300246002/" target="_blank">oldest and leak-prone pipeline networks</a> in the US. Columbia Gas had announced it was upgrading its pipes to comply with a Massachusetts law but had raised utility rates to pay for the upgrade.

#### Why does this matter?

Because the toll on human lives is significant and the company's alleged delayed response may have exacerbated the impacts of the explosions on residents. Officials say the investigation is still in the very early stages, but expect Columbia Gas to be in the hot seat for the next few weeks. We will be surprised if the company walks away scot free from this disaster.
