A US government report released on November 20 said that opioid-related drug problems cost the US economy $504 billion in 2015 alone. The report by the [Council of Economic Advisers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/The%20Underestimated%20Cost%20of%20the%20Opioid%20Crisis.pdf) showed that deaths linked to opioid overdose has steadily been rising since 1999. “The opioid drug problem has reached crisis levels in the United States. Over 50,000 Americans died of a drug overdose in 2015, of which 63 percent (33,091) reportedly involved opioids. The problem is worsening at an alarming pace, with opioid-involved overdose deaths doubling in the past ten years and quadrupling in the past sixteen,” the Council said.

*Whoa!*

This goes to show that the opioid problem has broad and far-reaching consequences. The estimated cost of $504 billion is six times the previous estimates, which means that the consequences are more serious than initially thought. The latest estimate is attributed to the cost of fatalities and income loss, health care expenses, criminal justice expenditures, and reduced productivity. In October, President Donald J. Trump declared the opioid problem a [“public health emergency”](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/politics/trump-opioid-crisis.html), although without additional funds to combat it, we’re not sure what the White House can accomplish given the scale of the crisis.

*Our take*

There is no quick and easy fix to this problem, but one critical area to look at is the pharmaceutical industry. A [60 Minute-Washington Post investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/investigations/dea-drug-industry-congress/?utm_term=.61914d869669) found that the industry is responsible for fueling opioid use by influencing legislation in its favor. We think there is no better way to solve the drug problem than going after the source.

***BARELY A WEEK LATER...***

**Controversial pipeline approved**

The Public Service Commission of the state of Nebraska approved on November 20 the controversial Keystone XL pipeline operated by TransCanada Corp. The Commission voted 3-2 in favor of Keystone XL, but required an alternative route for the pipeline. The approval comes barely a week after another TransCanada pipeline spilled approximately 5,000 barrels of oil in South Dakota.

*What is this all about?*

[Keystone XL](http://www.keystone-xl.com/) is a proposed 1,179-mile pipeline that will transport heavy crude extracted from oil sands in Canada’s Alberta province all the way to the US midwest. It is projected to carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day and supporters believe that it will reduce America’s oil dependency on the Middle East.

The pipeline, however, has faced severe opposition in the US for various reasons, including potential infringement of Native American lands and culture, and risks on a major source of water supply. Some also oppose the project because of their fundamental opposition to oil sands, which produce more greenhouse gas emissions than standard crude oil. Former US President Barack Obama [rejected](http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/06/politics/keystone-xl-pipeline-decision-rejection-kerry/index.html) the pipeline, but President Trump [gave his approval](http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska/trump-approves-keystone-xl-pipeline-ricketts-calls-action-a-great/article_36c0a1e2-0ff0-11e7-b728-b3dc72742617.html) in March 2017.

*Not the end of story*

Nebraska’s approval is not necessarily a win-all for TransCanada. It needs to adopt an alternative route, east of its preferred route, which would open up the company to new opposition, in addition to current ones. For both the company and activists, the battle continues.
