### Walmart CEO's paycheck is 1,188 times bigger than average worker

Walmart reported last week that it paid its CEO, Doug McMillion, $22.8 million in 2017, approximately 1,188 times the median pay of its worker. The median pay of Walmart employees in 2017 was $19,177. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-walmart-the-ceo-makes-1-188-times-as-much-as-the-median-worker-1524261608" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal noted</a> that this makes Walmart the 10th company among S&P 500 companies with the widest pay gap between the CEO and its average worker.

#### Are there other companies?

Believe it or not, Walmart's pay differential is not exceptional. Other companies that have reported high CEO-to-worker ratio in 2017 include Yum China Holdings Inc., the operator of Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants, with a ratio of 2,818:1 and technology company Aptiv Plc with 2,526:1. <a href="https://www.bna.com/ceotoworker-pay-reports-n57982090836/" target="_blank">Bloomberg reported</a> that nine companies have reported ratios of more than 1,000 as of April 5. Among such companies are Childrenâ€™s Place Inc., with a ratio of 1,813:1, Kohl's Corp. with 1,264:1, and Six Flags Entertainment Corp. with 1,804:1. Experts say the retail industry posts large pay gaps due to the use of seasonal and hourly workers.

#### Why does this matter?

The large pay gap between top executives and their workers is an increasing concern among shareholders because executive compensation continues to grow lackluster corporate performance. There are concerns that executives may be incentivized to boost short-term performance (read: stock prices), to boost their compensation. Moreover, excessive executive compensation contributes to the widening income inequality in the US.
