### German carmakers may have tested on monkeys, humans

German car makers, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler are facing allegations of having used monkeys and humans to test car emissions. According to media reports, different experiments were carried out between 2010 and 2014, and were commissioned by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), which were funded by the three major German car makers. It contracted the  Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico to run the tests.

#### What were the experiments?

The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/business/german-carmakers-diesel-monkeys.html" target="_blank">New York Times reported</a> that one experiment conducted in 2014 involved "exposing a group to monkeys to exhaust from a late-model diesel Volkswagen, while another group was exposed to exhaust from an older Ford diesel pickup. After breathing diluted exhaust for four hours, the monkeys were examined and researchers took samples of lung tissue to check for inflammation." The test was apprently conducted to prove the Beetle's clean emission standards. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/01/29/german-car-makers-backed-studies-exposing-people-and-monkeys-to-toxic-car-exhaust/?utm_term=.7c0acdbcca5a" target="_blank">Washington Post reported</a> that experiments to test nitrogen dioxide levels in 2012 and 2015 used human subjects, although the tests resembled emissions under normal traffic conditions and there are no reports of injuries or illness after the experiments.

#### What do the carmakers have to say?

BMW flat out denied its involvement. Daimler said it was "shocked by the extent and application of the studies", while Volkswagen pointed to the "mistakes and misjudgments of individuals". The EUGT had closed down in 2017 and the results of the experiments were never published.

#### These tests matters because...

Testing on animals is unethical. There are norms and regulations surrounding the use of animals for research purposes. Animal testing may only be conducted for a clear scientific purpose.
Animal testing is banned in the European Union, and in some US states. Meanwhile, testing on humans is a big no no. As the German government noted, these allegations are "in no way ethically unjustifiable" and "repugnant".

### Britain to fine companies ill-prepared for a cyberattack

The British government will fine companies in critical industries up to Â£17 million if their cyber security measures are found to be inadequate or ineffective. The government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-acts-to-protect-essential-services-from-cyber-attack" target="_blank">announced</a> that the new order covers companies in the energy, transport, water and health industries in order to protect the country's essential services in the event of a security breach. It will set up a new reporting system for companies to report cyber breaches and IT failures "so they can be quickly identified and acted upon".

#### Why does this matter?

Last year, UK hospitals were among those severely impacted by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/12/nhs-ransomware-cyber-attack-what-is-wanacrypt0r-20" target="_blank">WannaCry ransomware attack</a>. At least 16 hospitals were shut down as patient records, appointment schedules, and medical equipment connections were brought down or became inaccessible. Along with the US, the UK has blamed North Korea for unleashing WannaCry.

#### Our take

The UK's National Health Service were vulnerable to WannaCry because they were using an obsolete Windows version that Microsoft had stopped supporting in 2014. Ever heard of the word upgrade?
