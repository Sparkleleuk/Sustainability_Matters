**The Arctic Ocean is open for business**

An alliance of climate activists, including Greenpeace and the former director of Nasaâ€™s Goddard institute for space studies, James Hansen, is [suing Norway](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/18/norway-faces-climate-lawsuit-over-oil-exploration-plans) for reopening the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling. The two groups are invoking Article 112 of Norway's constitutional environmental law that guarantees citizens' right to a "healthy, diverse and productive environment". The Norwegian government has handed out oil exploration licenses to at least 13 oil companies including Chevron and Statoil for drilling in the Barents Sea.

*Why does this matter?*

The Arctic Ocean is one of the last frontiers for oil and is estimated to contain [13% of the earth's undiscovered oil](http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/arctic-impacts/The-dangers-of-Arctic-oil/). This is equivalent to approximately 90 billion barrels, but just enough to meet the worldwide demand for three years. With most oil fields drying up, the Arctic Ocean has, thus, become attractive for oil companies. But environmental groups say that oil companies are not prepared to mitigate and manage the risks that come with drilling in such harsh conditions in a sensitive environment. Therefore, the risk of oil spills and industrial waste could be higher and these have the potential to affect biodiversity for decades as spill and toxic waste cleanup is much harder in the Arctic.

*Our take*

For countries in North America and Europe, the Arctic Ocean is particularly important because it contributes to the inflow and outflow of water from and into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This is to say that if the Arctic Ocean is contaminated, much of that will eventually flow our way.

***DO YOU KNOW...***

**BMW will go fully renewable**

BMW, the Germany luxury car maker, has announced that by 2020, it will use [renewable energy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-14/bmw-dumps-coal-for-cow-pies-in-pledge-for-100-renewable-power) for all its 31 production sites in 14 countries. To meet that target, BMW is tapping various sources of green power including a biomass plant in South Africa, which runs on cow dung and chicken droppings.

*Oh yeah?*

BMW has been greening its operations for many years, hence this announcement does not come as a surprise. However. BMW and most luxury cars continue to run on diesel, a heavy pollutant associated with public health impacts. In fact, a [study](http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/14823/) found that diesel emissions may have contributed to approximately 10,000 premature deaths in the European Union in 2013. Props to BMW for going 100% renewable for its production facilities, but it needs to do much more than that to be truly green.
