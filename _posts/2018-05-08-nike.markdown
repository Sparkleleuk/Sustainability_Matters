### Purge in Nike's top brass over workplace misconduct

A total of 11 top executives at sports company Nike Inc. have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/business/nike-harassment.html?hpw&rref=business&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well" target="_blank">resigned</a> following an investigation into alleged workplace misconduct. This week alone, Nike confirmed that five more top executives have resigned as a result of the investigation into allegations of harassment and discrimination against female employees. The executives who have left or are leaving including the president of the Nike brand, heads of North American business units, and Nike's head of diversity and inclusion.

#### The rundown

The sweeping investigation was triggered by a survey conducted by a group of female employees in Nike's headquarters in Oregon. The survey results <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/business/nike-women.html" target="_blank">reportedly revealed</a> a culture that was demeaning to women and stifled their professional growth. The results were presented to Nike's CEO Mike Parker on March 5. In a company-wide meeting on May 5, Parker <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/mark-parker-nike.html" target="_blank">apologized to Nike staff</a>, saying that he missed the warning signs of discontent in the company. He vowed to address the allegations and went ahead and did it.

#### Why does this matter?

Because #TimesUp in one of the most iconic companies in the world. Nike has been one of leaders in sustainability, notably known of changing its supply chain management to prevent recurrence of the use of child labor. And yet the company harbored a dark secret that has finally come out in the open. Props to Mike Parker for acting on the anonymous survey swiftly and decisively, but hope he keeps his eyes and ears a bit more open next time.
