### #MeToo victims in Uber and Lyft can now go to court

Ride sharing companies Uber and Lyft <a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-will-1526337526-c2ac44d0-7fcd-45ef-9831-aa0c51db421a.html" target="_blank"> today announced</a> that they are no longer requiring individual claims of sexual assault and sexual harassment to go through arbitration proceedings. This means that victims can now choose to go to court if they wish to do so.

#### Tell me more

In addition to ending mandatory arbitration, Uber also announced that it will no longer require victims to sign a confidentiality agreement covering the facts of the harassment or assault as part of a settlement. The company also committed to reporting on sexual harassment and assault incidents that occur via its services.

#### And Lyft follows the lead

A <a href="https://www.axios.com/lyft-uber-mandatory-arbitration-sexual-assault-harassment-3713ecec-65e7-4a91-a5cc-da8032977f72.html" target="_blank">Lyft spokesperson said</a>, "Today, 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company, Uber made the good decision to adjust their policies. We agree with the changes and have removed the confidentiality requirement for sexual assault victims, as well as ended mandatory arbitration for those individuals so that they can choose which venue is best for them. This policy extends to passengers, drivers and Lyft employees."

#### The caveat

As Axios reported, both companies are still on the fence on class action lawsuits. The changes apply to individual claims but victims are still prohibited from filing class action lawsuits on sexual assault or harassment. Moreover, any settlement made with Uber will still remain confidential.

#### Why the change?

Uber's history with sexual harassment and assault is notorious. Remember those wild parties under former CEO Travis Kalanick? Morever, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/30/technology/uber-driver-sexual-assault/index.html" target="_blank"> at least 103 Uber drivers have faced allegations of sexual assault or abuse</a> in the last four years. Uber has been trying to make things right and CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has told CNN that cracking down on sexual assault is a "new priority". The company wants to be "part of the solution" to end sexual violence.

#### Why does this matter?

Because forced arbitration requirements have been used by companies to silence victims of sexual assault and/or harassment and keep these incidents under wraps. Did you ever wonder why #MeToo took years to come out? Experts say arbitration clauses were partly to blame, because these provisions forced women to remain silent. By dropping forced arbitration, Uber and Lyft are allowing sexual violence cases to come out in the open even at great risk to their reputation. Gotta give them credit for that.

#### **Quote of the day: Lois Lane's crusade**

<i>It's bound to leak, there's no way it's not going to ... they always assure us these things are safe, and they never are safe.</i> ~ Margot Kidder when she was <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/08/23/oil-sands-protests-margot_n_934175.html" target="_blank">arrested during a protest action against the Keystone XL pipeline</a> in 2011. Kidder is best known for playing Lois Lane opposite Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent, but she spent the rest of her life in Montana supporting different causes such as mental health awareness. Kidder passed away today at 69. RIP.
