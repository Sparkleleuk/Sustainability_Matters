### Latest California wildfires are the deadliest ever

The figures are out. The <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/11/12/california-wildfires-death-tolls-damage-camp-woolsey-hill-what-we-know/1974551002/" target="_blank">death toll</a> from the wildfires in California rose to 31 today, with more than 200 people still unaccounted for and more than 150,000 people still displaced. The wildfires are estimated to amount to $19 billion in damages.

#### What we know

There are currently six fires monitored in California, three are considered major fires. Camp Fire in northern California is the largest and destroyed a city called Paradise. At least 29 of the 31 fatalities were reported in this area. As of today, this fire is only 25% contained. Woolsey Fire in southern California has destroyed more than 83,000 acres and is 20% contained, while the Hill Fire struck Ventury County near Malibu, burning 4,500 acres and is 70% contained. Two people were killed in the southern California fires.

#### Other impacts

Insurers are bracing for an increase in claims as multimillion dollar homes in southern California were gutted by fires. AIG and Chubb Ltd. are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-12/aig-chubb-dispatch-wildfire-crews-as-california-blazes-spread?srnd=premium" target="_blank">reportedly</a> deploying specialist teams and former firefighters to spray retardants on homes to prevent more damage. Meanwhile, utility companies PG&E and Edison saw <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-fire-pge-edison-20181112-story.html" target="_blank">big drops</a> in their stock prices as investors anticipated that both companies might be hit by liabilities from the fire. Susquehanna Financial Group estimates that PG&E could face as much as $5 billion in liabilities from the Camp Fire. The company faces as much as $17.3 billion from last year's fires, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate.

#### Why does this matter?

These wildfires are yet another clear indication of extreme weather. The fires are fueled by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-12/california-fires-looking-as-costly-as-hurricane-at-19-billion?srnd=premium" target="_blank">high winds and dry conditions</a> even as the rest of the continental US start to experience winter-like conditions. Wildfires in California are also getting bigger and more difficult to contain, and are generally occurring more frequently. If this is not a sign of climate change, we don't know what is.
