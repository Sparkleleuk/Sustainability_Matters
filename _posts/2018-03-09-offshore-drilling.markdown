### Oil industry shows the money

<a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/377618-oil-industry-trumps-offshore-drilling-plan-could-contribute-590b-to" target="_blank">Studies sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute</a> said offshore drilling could bring in $590 billion to the US economy over two decades. One of the studies said that drilling in the Atlantic alone could bring in $260 billion, while drilling in the Pacific could bring in $160 billion. The oil industry also said offshore drilling could also benefit communities through jobs and other forms of livelihood. The studies were released Friday.

#### A quick flashback

The Trump administration is proposing to <a href="https://www.sustainabilitymatters.info/environment/2018/01/04/offshore-drilling.html" target="_blank">reopen US coastal waters</a> to offshore drilling to boost America's energy independence. The Department of Interior wants to sell leases in 25 out of the 26 offshore planning areas in the US, covering 90% of the US outer continental shelf. The government is also planning to open the Arctic and the Eastern seaboard to oil and gas exploration for the first time, including in areas with fragile ecosystems.

#### What are the anti-drilling advocates saying?

A few days prior, Oceana, a conservation group opposed to drilling, released its own economic analysis, saying that drilling threatens 2.6 million jobs and almost $180 billion in economic activity in coastal economies. The group said offshore drilling carries plenty of risks including damage to oceans. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said offshore drilling is a really really dumb idea".

#### Our take

It's easy to be dazzled by the money especially when the oil industry is doing its best to do a Jerry Maguire. If divided equally over two decades, offshore drilling could bring in close to $30 billion every year for 20 years. The economic benefits of oil and gas drilling are not disputed. The angle is whether the benefits outweigh the risks in light of persistent warnings on the negative consequences of climate change. And risks have increased because the Trump government has been busy rolling back environmental laws. Remember that total bill for BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/bps-big-bill-for-the-worlds-largest-oil-spill-now-reaches-616-billion/2016/07/14/7248cdaa-49f0-11e6-acbc-4d4870a079da_story.html?utm_term=.e70c1c3cfe03" target="_blank">$61 billion</a>, more than double the projected annual gains from offshore drilling. And this was for one oil spill alone. Imagine what could happen if large spills occur more frequently. Then everybody cries over spilt milk.

**BEFORE YOU GO..**

#### **We've been reading**

A groundbreaking study on fake news published in the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1146.full" target="_blank">Science journal</a> and summarized by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/largest-study-ever-fake-news-mit-twitter/555104/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>. The study concludes that fake news travels faster than the truth, and it travels via Twitter. According to The Atlantic: "A false story is much more likely to go viral than a real story, the authors find. A false story reaches 1,500 people six times quicker, on average, than a true story does. And while false stories outperform the truth on every subject—including business, terrorism and war, science and technology, and entertainment—fake news about politics regularly does best." A grim conclusion indeed.
