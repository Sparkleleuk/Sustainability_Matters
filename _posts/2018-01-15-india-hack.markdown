### India's biometric database may have been breached

Indian media have reported that the country's massive biometric database, Aadhaar, has been breached and access to a database that contains private identification details of more than 1 billion people, is now being sold in the black market. The <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-500-10-minutes-and-you-have-access-to-billion-aadhaar-details/523361.html" target="_blank">Tribune News Service journalists reported</a> that they were able to buy a login and password to access the database for 500 Indian rupees (approximately $8) through an agent contacted via Whatsapp. For another 300 Indian rupees, the journalists were able to obtain a software that allowed them to print an identity card after entering an Aadhaar number.

#### The government denies it

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the government entity that maintains Aadhaar has <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uidai-denies-any-breach-of-aadhaar-data/523469.html" target="_blank">denied</a> that there has been a breach and that the Tribune article was a case of "misreporting". The UIDAI said biometric information and data are "fully safe".

#### A quick background, please

An Aadhaar is a 12-digit identification number issued to each Indian national and is an important piece of identification for financial transactions. The number is linked to an individual's fingerprint and other personal data that has been submitted to the UIDAI.

#### Redflagged

Media reports point to striking vulnerabilities in the database, such as <a href="https://www.thequint.com/news/india/exclusive-aadhaar-dirty-secret-out-add-anyone-as-data-admin" target="_blank">lax admin controls</a> that allow those with admin access to give admin access to other individuals. Thus, an individual with administrator access can add other individuals as administrators and these new administrators can, in turn, add their friends as administrators and so on and so forth. Sounds like a fun slumber party only that this is a government database we're talking about here.


#### Why is this important?

If proven true, this may constitute one of the largest data breaches in terms of the number of people at risk. It compromises the privacy of more than 1 billion Indian nationals, and opens them up to identity theft. It also highlights the vulnerability of government databases even to simple methods of breaching cybersecurity. The Tribune's report suggests that someone with admin access may have been selling additional admin access to willing buyers. While this is not a hack in the way that, say, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yahoo-cyber/yahoo-says-all-three-billion-accounts-hacked-in-2013-data-theft-idUSKCN1C82O1" target="_blank">Yahoo was hacked</a>, the possession of admin access by individuals without authority AND the use of this unauthorized admin access still constitute a breach in the database, there is no way around it.
