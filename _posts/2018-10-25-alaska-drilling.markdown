### Texas-based energy firm approved to drill for oil in Alaska

The Department of Interior has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/24/trump-administration-just-approved-plan-drill-oil-alaskas-federal-waters-its-major-first/?utm_term=.01f594ef3e11" target="_blank">allowed</a> Texas-based Hilcorp Energy Company LLC to drill for oil and gas off the shores of Alaska, the first permit to be approved in federal waters.

#### Tell me more

Houston-based Hilcorp is <a href="http://libertyenergyproject.com/" target="_blank">proposing</a> to build a nine-acre artificial gravel island about 15 east of Prudhoe Bay, not far from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The island will sit about six miles offshore in 19 feet of water. It will near be four other artificial islands built for oil and gas drilling. The Houston-based company wants to tap into oil reserves on Alaska's North Slope, estimated at 80 to 150 million barrels.

#### Miss Liberty Bell

Hilcorp is calling this the "Liberty Project". It is expected to take two years to complete and expected to produce up to 70,000 barrels a day for 15 to 20 years. And the artificial island will aptly be called Liberty Island.

#### Why does this matter?

This is the first oil and gas drilling project approved as part of the tax bill that was signed into law last year. Oil and gas exploration in protected federal territory was vigorously opposed by environmental advocates because of the risk that it would damage biodiversity and accelerate climate change. But the Trump administration wants to pursue energy dominance, so the bill passed. The approval is only at the federal level and Hilcorp still needs to obtain state and other local approvals. It's likely to get them though. Alaska's politicians support oil and gas exploration to help fund the state budget. The drilling season has begun.

#### **Happy belated #MeToo Moment, Google**

Google has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-harassment/googles-sundar-pichai-says-48-employees-were-fired-for-sexual-harassment-idUSKCN1MZ332" target="_blank">fired 48 people</a> for sexual harassment cases, some of which had not been acted on for years. Among those implicated is the "Father of Android", Andy Rubin, who left the company in 2014. The announcement came after a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html" target="_blank">New York Times story</a> about alleged coverup of such cases in the tech company.
