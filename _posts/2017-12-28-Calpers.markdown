### Lobby group hits at Calpers' fund returns

A Washington DC-based lobby group has criticized the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) for investing the pension fund with environment, social and governance (ESG) considerations. In a <a href="http://accfcorpgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CalPERS-Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank">report released on December 2017</a>, the <a href="http://accf.org/" target="_blank">American Council for Capital Formation</a> (ACCF) accused Calpers of prioritizing ESG at the expense of returns. The ACCF said that the fund's performance has declined over the last 10 years, linking the decline to "increased ESG investing and activism".

#### Calpers hits back

The pension fund, one of the largest in the US, <a href="https://www.ai-cio.com/news/calpers-calls-esg-criticism-laughable/" target="_blank">responded</a> that it works "to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns possible" and that incorporation of ESG is an "important part" of its decision making process.

#### Why do pension funds incorporate ESG in the first place?

Pension funds integrate ESG factors in their investments primarily as a risk mitigation measure. Unlike many other investors, pension funds hold investments for long period of time and are motivated to minimize risks to their portfolios through exposure to companies that are unable to manage long-term issues, such as climate change or water scarcity. Recently, the Norwegian pension fund, the world's largest sovereign fund, said it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/16/oil-and-gas-shares-dip-as-norways-central-bank-advises-oslo-to-divest" target="_blank">planning to divest</a> from fossil fuel companies, citing an anticipated weakening of oil prices due to climate risks. Pension funds also typically use their market power to influence corporate behavior. In one of the biggest wins by US pension funds this year, Exxon Mobil <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12122017/exxon-climate-risk-disclosure-sec-shareholder-investigation-pressure" target="_blank">agreed to drop its opposition</a> to a shareholder resolution filed by the New York State Retirement Fund and supported by other asset owners, and agreed to disclose climate risks annually.

#### Our take: This hate mail is sus

By criticizing Calpers, the ACCF is effectively questioning the value of ESG integration in investment strategies. This is, however, inconsistent with the growing trend among global asset owners (like pension funds) and professional asset managers (like Blackrock and State Street) to incorporate ESG in its investment strategies. Professionally-managed assets that incorporate ESG has grown by 33% to $8.72 trillion in 2016 from 2014 in the US alone, according to the <a href="https://www.ussif.org/files/SIF_Trends_16_Executive_Summary(1).pdf" target="_blank">US Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investing</a>. Moreover, consider the ACCF's <a href="http://conservativetransparency.org/recipient/american-council-for-capital-formation/" target="_blank">list of donors</a>: Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the American Petroleum Institute, Exxon Mobil, to name a few.  Doesn't this list give you reason to be suspicious of the group's real intentions?
