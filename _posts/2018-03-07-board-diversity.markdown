### US corporate boardrooms becoming more diverse

Boards of directors in America are becoming more diverse as more women are appointed directors. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/fearless-girl-s-first-year-helped-reshape-corporate-boardrooms" target="_blank">Data by Bloomberg</a> show that over the last 10 years, the number of all-male boards among the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell_1000index.asp" target="_blank">Russell 1000</a> companies dropped from a high of 176 companies in 2009 to 47 in 2018.

#### And there's more

According to State Street, a large Boston-based investment manager, there are more female board members percentage wise than senior female executives. This means there are more female board directors than females who hold C-suite positions. Bloomberg reported that less than 5% of CEO roles in the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp" target="_blank">S&P Index</a> are held by women.

#### Why does this matter?

Because for the longest time, corporate America was dominated by white men. Corporate boards were ran by people who think, talk and walk alike, leaving no room for alternative views and insights from people with different experiences and viewpoints. An all-male squad may have been the dream team in the 1950s, but it won't make the cut in today's more globalized economic environment. This trend also shows that pressure by investment managers representing trillions of dollars in capital is finally working. Investors have been pushing for gender diversity in the board for nearly a decade under the firm belief that diversity is critical to protecting shareholder value. Investors can give themselves a pat in the back for this big win.

#### Our take

Sure, it is entirely possible that some companies appointed women to check the diversity box. Some may have done it to get investors off their case. But whatever their reasons are, the ship has sailed and it is clear that women are getting more representation in corporate boards. Now it's up to these women to seize the opportunity to be heard and leave their mark.

#### P.S.

Interestingly, the Bloomberg chart shows that the number of all-male corporate boards in the Russell 1000 grew steadily from 2006 to 2009. And what is the period known for? The Great Recession. Note that the financial sector is one of the highest weighted sector in the Russell 1000. Call it a stretch but the Great Recession does not really give a boost of confidence to the all-male boardroom.

#### **Quote of the day: When you say nothing at all**

<em>Any solutions on how to address this epidemic will be complicated. This is why our company believes the best way to make progress on these issues is through the political and legislative process. We plan to engage our customers that legally manufacture firearms and other stakeholders on what we can do together to promote better gun safety for our communities.</em> - Statement from Wells Fargo, reacting to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/nra-s-banker-wells-fargo-climbs-to-top-of-gunmaker-debt-market" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a> that it has arranged the largest amount of loans for gun manufacturers since 2012.
