**What is Sustainability Matters?**

Sustainability Matters aims to highlight sustainability-related news and make practical sense of it all. It is intended to inform and educate a diverse set of readers on the relevance of sustainability in our day to day lives so that we, as ordinary folks, can make informed decisions and take action to make the world a healthier, safer and more sustainable place to live in.

**What is Sustainability?**

The million dollar question. Believe it or not, there is no formal definition of sustainability. However, the use of the word sustainability has evolved from environmental matters to include an array of themes from human rights and diversity to corporate ethics and governance.

When we talk about sustainability, we are not just talking about recycling. In fact, we may not even talk about recycling at all. We monitor a range of environmental, social and governance topics that contribute to a sustainable and resilient world. We take our cue from the [UN World Commission on Environment and Development](http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf), and the mission of the [Principles for Responsible Investment](https://www.unpri.org/about).

**How does Sustainability Matters work?**

Every week day, we will highlight and analyze a maximum of three relevant and interesting sustainability-related news. The analysis will be posted on this site at 0600 Eastern Standard Time.
